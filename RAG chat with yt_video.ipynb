this course Lance Martin will teach  you how to implement rag from scratch  Lance is a software engineer at Lang  chain and Lang chain is one of the most  common ways to implement rag Lance will  help you understand how to use rag to  combine custom data with llms hi this is  Lance Martin I'm a software engineer at  Lang chain I'm going to be giving a  short course focused on rag or retrieval  augmented generation which is one of the  most popular kind of ideas and  in llms  today so really the motivation for this  is that most of the world's data is  private um whereas llms are trained on  publicly available data so you can kind  of see on the bottom on the x-axis the  number of tokens using pre-training  various llms so it kind of varies from  say 1.5 trillion tokens in the case of  smaller models like  52 out to some very large number that we  actually don't know for proprietary  models like GPT 4 CLA  three but what's really interesting is  that the context window or the ability  to feed external information into these  LMS is actually getting larger so about  a year ago context windows were between  4 and 8,000 tokens you know that's like  maybe a dozen pages of text we've  recently seen models all the way out to  a million tokens which is thousands of  pages of text so while these llms are  trained on large scale public data it's  increasingly feasible to feed them  this huge mass of private data that  they've never seen that private data can  be your kind of personal data it can be  corporate data or you know other  information that you want to pass to an  LM that's not natively in his training  set and so this is kind of the main  motivation for rag it's really the idea  that llms one are kind of the the center  of a new kind of operating  system and two it's increasingly  critical to be able to feed information  from external sources such as private  data into llms for processing so that's  kind of the overarching motivation for  Rag and now rag refers to retrieval  augmented generation and you can think  of it in three very general steps  there's a process of indexing of  external data so you can think about  this as you know building a database for  example um many companies already have  large scale databases in different forms  they could be SQL DBS relational DBS um  they could be Vector Stores um or  otherwise but the point is that  documents are indexed such that they can  be retrieved based upon some heuristics  relative to an input like a question and  those relevant documents can be passed  to an llm and the llm can produce  answers that are grounded in that  retrieved information so that's kind of  the centerpiece or central idea behind  Rag and why it's really powerful  technology because it's really uniting  the the knowledge and processing  capacity of llms with large scale  private external data source for which  most of the important data in the world  still  lives and in the following short videos  we're going to kind of build up a  complete understanding of the rag  landscape and we're going to be covering  a bunch of interesting papers and  techniques that explain kind of how to  do rag and I've really broken it down  into a few different sections  so starting with a question on the left  the first kind of section is what I call  query trans translation so this captures  a bunch of different methods to take a  question from a user and modify it in  some way to make it better suited for  retrieval from you know one of these  indexes we've talked  about that can use methods like query  writing it can be decomposing the query  into you know constituent sub  questions then there's a question of  routing so taking that decomposed a  Rewritten question and routing it to the  right place you might have multiple  Vector stores a relational DB graph DB  and a vector store so it's the challenge  of getting a question to the right  Source then there's a there's kind of  the challenge of query construction  which is basically taking natural  language and converting it into the DSL  necessary for whatever data source you  want to work with a classic example here  is text a SQL which is kind of a very  kind of well studied process but text a  cipher for graph DV is very interesting  text to metadata filters for Vector DBS  is also a very big area of  study um then there's indexing so that's  the process of taking your documents and  processing them in some way so they can  be easily retrieved and there's a bunch  of techniques for that we'll talk  through we'll talk through different  embedding methods we'll talk about  different indexing  strategies after  retrieval there are different techniques  to rerank or filter retrieve documents  um and then finally we'll talk about  generation and kind of an interesting  new set of methods to do what we might  call as active rag so in that retrieval  or generation stage grade documents  grade answers um grade for relevance to  the question grade for faithfulness to  the documents I.E check for  hallucinations and if either fail  feedback uh re- retrieve or rewrite the  question uh regenerate the qu regenerate  the answer and so forth so there's a  really interesting set of methods we're  going to talk through that cover that  like retrieval and generation with  feedback and you know in terms of  General outline we'll cover the basics  first it'll go through indexing  retrieval and generation kind of in the  Bare Bones and then we'll talk through  more advanced techniques that we just  saw on the prior slide career  Transformations routing uh construction  and so forth hi this is Lance from Lang  chain this the second video in our  series rack from scratch focused on  indexing  so in the past video you saw the main  kind of overall components of rag  pipelines indexing retrieval and  generation and here we're going to kind  of Deep dive on indexing and give like  just a quick overview of it so the first  aspect of indexing is we have some  external documents that we actually want  to load and put into what we're trying  to call Retriever and the goal of this  retriever is simply given an input  question I want to fish out doents that  are related to my question in some  way now the way to establish that  relationship or relevance or similarity  is typically done using some kind of  numerical representation of documents  and the reason is that it's very easy to  compare vectors for example of numbers  uh relative to you know just free form  text and so a lot of approaches have  been a developed over the years to take  text documents and compress them down  into a numerical rep presentation that  then can be very easily  searched now there's a few ways to do  that so Google and others came up with  many interesting statistical methods  where you take a document you look at  the frequency of words and you build  what they call sparse vectors such that  the vector locations are you know a  large vocabulary of possible words each  value represents the number of  occurrences of that particular word and  it's sparse because there's of course  many zeros it's a very large vocabulary  relative to what's present in the  document and there's very good search  methods over this this type of numerical  representation now a bit more recently  uh embedding methods that are machine  learned so you take a document and you  build a compressed fixed length  representation of that  document um have been developed with  correspondingly very strong search  methods over  embeddings um so the intuition here is  that we take documents and we typically  split them because embedding models  actually have limited context windows so  you know on the order of maybe 512  tokens up to 8,000 tokens or Beyond but  they're not infinitely large so  documents are split and each document is  compressed into a vector and that Vector  captures a semantic meaning of the  document itself the vectors are indexed  questions can be embedded in the exactly  same way and then numerical kind of  comparison in some form you know using  very different types of methods can be  performed on these vectors to fish out  relevant documents relative to my  question um and let's just do a quick  code walk through on some of these  points so I have my notebook here I've  installed here um now I've set a few API  keys for lsmith which are very useful  for tracing which we'll see  shortly um previously I walked through  this this kind of quick start that just  showed overall how to lay out these rag  pipelines and here what I'll do is I'll  Deep dive a little bit more on indexing  and I'm going to take a question and a  document and first I'm just going to  compute the number of tokens in for  example the question and this is  interesting because embedding models in  llms more generally operate on tokens  and so it's kind of nice to understand  how large the documents are that I'm  trying to feed in in this case it's  obviously a very small in this case  question now I'm going to specify open  eye embeddings I specify an embedding  model here and I just say embed embed  query I can pass my question my document  and what you can see here is that runs  and this is mapped to now a vector of  length 1536 and that fixed length Vector  representation will be computed for both  documents and really for any document so  you're always is kind of computing this  fix length Vector that encodes the  semantics of the text that you've passed  now I can do things like cosine  similarity to compare  them and as we'll see here I can load  some documents this is just like we saw  previously I can split  them and I can index them here just like  we did before but we can see under the  hood really what we're doing is we're  taking each split we're embedding it  using open eye embeddings into this this  kind of this Vector representation and  that's stored with a link to the rod  document itself in our Vector store and  next we'll see how to actually do  retrieval using this Vector store hi  this is Lance from Lang chain and this  is the third video in our series rag  from scratch building up a lot of the  motivations for rag uh from the very  basic  components um so we're going to be  talking about retrieval today in the  last two uh short videos I outlined  indexing and gave kind of an overview of  this flow which starts with indexing of  our documents retrieval of documents  relevant to our question and then  generation of answers based on the  retriev  documents and so we saw that the  indexing process basically makes  documents easy to retrieve and it goes  through a flow that basically looks like  you take our documents you split them in  some way into these smaller chunks that  can be easily embedded um those  embeddings are then numerical  representations of those documents that  are easily  searchable and they're stored in an  index when given a question that's also  embedded the index performs a similarity  search and returns splits that are  relevant to the  question now if we dig a little bit more  under the hood we can think about it  like this if we take a document and  embed it let's imagine that embedding  just had three dimensions so you know  each document is projected into some  point in this 3D  space now the point is that the location  in space is determined by the semantic  meaning or content in that document so  to follow that then documents in similar  locations in space contain similar  semantic information and this very  simple idea is really the Cornerstone  for a lot of search and retrieval  methods that you'll see with modern  Vector stores so in particular we take  our documents we embed them into this in  this case a toy 3D space  we take our question do the  same we can then do a search like a  local neighborhood search you can think  about in this 3D space around our  question to say hey what documents are  nearby and these nearby neighbors are  then retrieved because they can they  have similar semantics relative to our  question and that's really what's going  on here so again we took our documents  we split them we embed them and now they  exist in this high dimensional space  we've taken our question embedded it  projected in that same space and we just  do a search around the question from  nearby documents and grab ones that are  close and we can pick some number we can  say we want one or two or three or n  documents close to my question in this  embedding space and there's a lot of  really interesting methods that  implement this very effectively I I link  one  here um and we have a lot of really nice  uh Integrations to play with this  general idea so many different embedding  models many different indexes lots of  document loaders um and lots of  Splitters that can be kind of recombined  to test different ways of doing this  kind of indexing or  retrieval um so now I'll show a bit of a  code walkth through so here we defined  um we kind of had walked through this  previously this is our notebook we've  installed a few packages we've set a few  environment variables using lsmith  and we showed this previously this is  just an overview showing how to run rag  like kind of end to end in the last uh  short talk we went through  indexing um and what I'm going to do  very simply is I'm just going to reload  our  documents so now I have our documents  I'm going to resplit  them and we saw before how we can build  our  index now here let's actually do the  same thing but in the slide we actually  showed kind of that notion of search in  that 3D  space and a nice parameter to think  about in building your your retriever is  K so K tells you the number of nearby  neighbors to fetch when you do that  retrieval process and we talked about  you know in that 3D space do I want one  nearby neighbor or two or three so here  we can specify k equals 1 for example  now we're building our index so we're  taking every split embedding it storing  it now what's nice is I asked a a  question what is Task decomposition this  is related to the blog post and I'm  going to run get relevant documents so I  run that and now how many documents do I  get back I get one as expected based  upon k equals 1 so this retrieve  document should be related to my  question now I can go to lsmith and we  can open it up and we can look at our  Retriever and we can see here was our  question here's the one document we got  back and okay so that makes sense this  document pertains to task ke  decomposition in particular and it kind  of lays out a number of different  approaches that can be used to do that  this all kind of makes sense and this  shows kind of in practice how you can  implement this this NE this kind of KNN  or k nearest neighbor search uh really  easily uh just using a few lines of code  and next we're going to talk about  generation  thanks hey this is Lance from Lang chain  this is the fourth uh short video in our  rack from scratch series  that's going to be focused on  generation now in the past few videos we  walked through the general flow uh for  kind of basic rag starting with indexing  Fall by  retrieval then  generation of an answer based upon the  documents that we retrieved that are  relevant to our question this is kind of  the the very basic  flow now an important consideration in  generation is really what's happening is  we're taking the documents you retrieve  and we're stuffing them into the llm  context window so if we kind of walk  back through the process we take  documents we split them for convenience  or embedding we then embed each split  and we store that in a vector store as  this kind of easily searchable numerical  representation or vector and we take a  question embed it to produce a similar  kind of numerical representation we can  then search for example using something  like KN andn in this kind of dimensional  space for documents that are similar to  our question based on their proximity or  location in this space in this case you  can see 3D is a toy kind of toy  example now we've recovered relevant  splits to our question we pack those  into the context window and we produce  our  answer now this introduces the notion of  a prompt so the prompt is kind of a you  can think have a placeholder that has  for example you know in our case B keys  so those keys can be like context and  question so they basically are like  buckets that we're going to take those  retrieve documents and Slot them in  we're going to take our question and  also slot it in and if you kind of walk  through this flow you can kind of see  that we can build like a dictionary from  our retrieve documents and from our  question and then we can basically  populate our prompt template with the  values from the dict and then becomes a  prompt value which can be passed to llm  like a chat model resulting in chat  messages which we then parse into a  string and get our answer so that's like  the basic workflow that we're going to  see and let's just walk through that in  code very quickly to kind of give you  like a Hands-On intuition so we had our  notebook we walk through previously  install a few packages I'm setting a few  lsmith environment variables we'll see  it's it's nice for uh kind of observing  and debugging our  traces um previously we did this quick  start we're going to skip that over  um and what I will do is I'm going to  build our retriever so again I'm going  to take documents and load them uh and  then I'm going to split them here we've  kind of done this previously so I'll go  through this kind of quickly and then  we're going to embed them and store them  in our index so now we have this  retriever object here now I'm going to  jump down here now here's where it's  kind of fun this is the generation bit  and you can see here I'm defining  something new this is a prompt template  and what my prompt template is something  really simple it's just going to say  answer the following question based on  this context it's going to have this  context variable and a question so now  I'm building my prompt so great now I  have this prompt let's define an llm  I'll choose  35 now this introdu the notion of a  chain so in Lang chain we have an  expression language called L Cel Lang  chain expression language which lets you  really easily compose things like  prompts LMS parsers retrievers and other  things but the very simple kind of you  know example here is just let's just  take our prompt which you defined right  here and connect it to an LM which you  defined right here into this chain so  there's our chain now all we're doing is  we're invoking that chain so every L  expression language chain has a few  common methods like invoke bat stream in  this case we just invoke it with a dict  so context and question that maps to the  expected Keys here in our template  and so if we run invoke what we see is  it's just going to execute that chain  and we get our answer now if we zoom  over to Langs Smith we should see that  it's been populated so yeah we see a  very simple runable  sequence here was our  document um and here's our output and  here is our prompt answer the following  question based on the context here's the  document we passed in here is the  question and then we get our answer so  that's pretty nice um now there's a lot  of other options for rag prompts I'll  pull one in from our prompt tub this  one's like kind of a popular prompt so  it just like has a little bit more  detail but you know it's the main the  main intuition is the same um you're  passing in documents you're asking them  to reason about the documents given a  question produce an answer and now here  I'm going to find a rag chain which will  automatically do the retrieval for us  and all I have to do is specify here's  my retriever which we defined  before here's our question we which we  invoke with the question gets passed  through to the key question in our dict  and it automatically will trigger the  retriever which will return documents  which get passed into our context so  it's exactly what we did up here except  before we did this  manually and  now um this is all kind of automated for  us we pass that dick which is autop  populated  into our prompt llm out to parser now  let invoke it and that should all just  run and great we get an answer and we  can look at the  trace and we can see everything that  happened so we can see our retriever was  run these documents were  retrieved they get passed into our  LM and we get our final answer so this  kind of the end of our overview um where  we talked about I'll go back to the  slide here quickly we talked about  indexing retrieval and now  generation and follow-up short videos  we'll kind of dig into some of the more  com complex or detailed themes that  address some limitations that can arise  in this very simple pipeline  thanks hi my from Lang chain over the  next few videos we're going to be  talking about career  translation um and in this first video  we're going to cover the topic of  multi-query  so query translation sits kind of at the  first stage of an advanced rag Pipeline  and the goal of career translation is  really to take an input user question  and to translate in some way in order to  improve  retrieval so the problem statement is  pretty intuitive user queries um can be  ambiguous and if the query is poorly  written because we're typically doing  some kind of semantic similarity search  between the query and our documents if  the query is poorly written or ill  opposed we won't retrieve the proper  documents from our  index so there's a few approaches to  attack this problem and you can kind of  group them in a few different ways so  here's one way I like to think about it  a few approaches has involveed query  rewriting so taking a query and  reframing it like writing from a  different perspective um and that's what  we're going to talk about a little bit  here in depth using approaches like  multi-query or rag Fusion which we'll  talk about in the next video you can  also do things like take a question and  break it down to make it less abstract  like into sub questions and there's a  bunch of interesting papers focused on  that like least to most from  Google you can also take the opposite  approach of take a question to make it  more abstract uh and there's actually  approach we're going to talk about later  in a future video called stepback  prompting that focuses on like kind of  higher a higher level question from the  input so the intuition though for this  multier approach is we're taking a  question and we're going to break it  down into a few differently worded  questions uh from different  perspectives and the intuition here is  simply that um it is possible that the  way a question is initially worded once  embedded it is not well aligned or in  close proximity in this High dimensional  embedding space to a document that we  want to R that's actually related so the  thinking is that by kind of rewriting it  in a few different ways you actually  increase the likel of actually  retrieving the document that you really  want to um because of nuances in the way  that documents and questions are  embedded this kind of more shotgun  approach of taking a question Fanning it  out into a few different perspectives  May improve and increase the reliability  of retrieval that's like the intuition  really um and of course we can com  combine this with retrieval so we can  take our our kind of fan out questions  do retrieval on each one and combine  them in some way and perform rag so  that's kind of the overview and now  let's what let's go over to um our code  so this is a notebook and we're going to  share all  this um we're just installing a few  packages we're setting a lsmith API Keys  which we'll see why that's quite useful  here shortly there's our diagram now  first I'm going to Index this blog post  on agents I'm going to split it um well  I'm going to load it I'm going to split  it and then I'm going to index it in  chroma locally so this is a vector store  we've done this previously so now I have  my index defined so here is where I'm  defining my prompt for multiquery which  is your your assistant your task is to  basically reframe this question into a  few different sub  questions um so there's our  prompt um right here we'll pass that to  an llm part it um into a string and then  split the string by new lines and so  we'll get a list of questions out of  this chain that's really all we're doing  here now all we're doing is here's a  sample input question there's our  generate queries chain which we defined  we're going to take that list and then  simply apply each question to retriever  so we'll do retrieval per question and  this little function here is just going  to take the unique Union of documents uh  across all those retrievals so let's run  this and see what happens so we're going  to run this and we're going to get some  set of questions uh or documents back so  let's go to Langs Smith now we can  actually see what happened under the  hood so here's the key  point we ran our initial chain to  generate a set of of reframed questions  from our input and here was that prompt  and here is that set of questions that  we generated now what happened is for  every one of those questions we did an  independent retrieval that's what we're  showing here so that's kind of the first  step which is great now I can go back to  the notebook and we can show this  working end to end so now we're going to  take that retrieval chain we'll pass it  into context of our final rag prompt  we'll also pass through the question  we'll pass that to our rag prompt here  pass it to an LM and then Pary output  now let's let's kind of see how that  works so again that's okay there it is  so let's actually go into langth and see  what happened under the hood so this was  our final chain so this is great we took  our input question we broke it out to  these like five rephrase questions for  every one of those we did a retrieval  that's all great we then took the unique  Union of documents and you can see in  our final llm prompt answer the  following cont following question based  on the context this is the final set of  unique documents that we retrieved from  all of our sub  questions um here's our initial question  there's our answer so that kind of shows  you how you can set this up really  easily how you can use l Smith to kind  of investigate what's going on and in  particular use l Smith to investigate  those intermediate questions that you  generate in that like kind of question  generation phase and in a future talks  we're going to go through um some of  these other methods that we kind of  introduced at the start of this one  thank  you last L chain this is the second  video of our Deep dive on query  translation in our rag from scratch  series focused on a method called rag  Fusion so as we kind of showed before  career translation you can think of as  the first stage in an advanced rag  pipeline we're taking an input user  question and We're translating it some  way in order to improve  retrievable now we showed this General  mapping of approaches previously so  again you have kind of like rewriting so  you can take a question and like kind of  break it down into uh differently worded  are different different perspectives of  the same question so that's kind of  rewriting there's sub questions where  you take a question break it down into  smaller problems solve each one  independently and then there step back  where you take a question and kind of go  more abstract where you kind of ask a  higher level question as a precondition  to answer the user question so those are  the approaches and we're going to dig  into one of the particular approaches  for rewriting called rat Fusion now this  is really similar to what we just saw  with multiquery  the difference being we actually apply a  a kind of a clever rank ranking step of  our retriev documents um which you call  reciprocal rank Fusion that's really the  only difference the the input stage of  taking a question breaking it out into a  few kind of differently worded questions  retrieval on each one is all the same  and we're going to see that in the code  here shortly so let's just hop over  there and then look at this so again  here is a notebook that we introduced  previously here's the packages we've  installed we've set a few API keys for  lsmith which we see why is quite  useful um and you can kind of go down  here to a rag Fusion  section and the first thing you'll note  is what our prompt is so it looks really  similar to The Prompt we just saw with  multiquery and simply your helpful  assistant that generates multiple search  queries based upon user input and here's  the question output for queries so let's  define our prompt and here was our query  Generation chain again this looks a lot  like we just saw we take our prompt Plum  that into an llm and then basically  parse by new lines and that'll basically  split out these questions into a list  that's all it's going to happen here so  that's cool now here's where the novelty  comes  in each time we do retrieval from one of  those questions we're going to get back  a list of documents from our Retriever  and so we do it over that we generate  four questions here based on our prompt  we do the over four questions well like  a list of lists  basically now reciprocal rank Fusion is  really well suited for this exact  problem we want to take this list to  list and build a single Consolidated  list and really all that's going on is  it's looking at the documents in each  list and kind of aggregating them into a  final output ranking um and that's  really the intuition around what's  happening  here um so let's go ahead  and so  let's so let's go ahead and look at that  in some detail so we can see we  run  retrieval that's great now let's go over  to Lang Smith and have a look at what's  going on here so we can see that here  was our prompt to your helpful assistant  that generates multiple search queries  based on a single input and here is our  search queries and then here are our  four retrievals so that's that's really  good so we know that all is  working um and then those retrievals  simply went into this rank  function and our correspondingly ranked  to a final list of six unique rank  documents that's really all we  did so let's actually put that all  together into an a full rag chain that's  going to run  retrieval return that final list of rank  documents and pass it to our context  pass through our question send that to a  rag prompt pass it to an LM parse it to  an output and let's run all that  together and see that  working cool so there's our final  answer now let's have a look in lsmith  we can see here was our four questions  here's our retrievals and then our final  rag prompt plumed through the final list  of ranked six questions which we can see  laid out here and our final answer so  this can be really convenient  particularly if we're operating across  like maybe different Vector stores uh or  we want to do like retrieval across a  large number of of kind of differently  worded questions this reciprocal rank  Fusion step is really nice um for  example if we wanted to only take the  top three documents or something um it  can be really nice to build that  Consolidated ranking across all these  independent retrievals then pass that to  for the final generation so that's  really the intuition about what's  happening here thanks  hi this is Lance from Lang chain this is  our third video focused on query  translation in the rag from scratch  series and we're going to be talking  about  decomposition so query translation in  general is a set of approaches that sits  kind of towards the front of this  overall rag Pipeline and the objective  is to modify or rewrite or otherwise  decompose an input question from a user  in order improve  retrieval so we can talk through some of  these approaches previously in  particular various ways to do query  writing like rag fusion and multiquery  there's a separate set of techniques  that become pretty popular and are  really interesting for certain problems  which we might call like kind of  breaking down or decomposing an input  question into a set of sub  questions um so some of the papers here  that are are pretty cool are for example  this work from  Google um and the objective really is  first to take an input question and  decompose it into a set of sub problems  so this particular example from the  paper was the problem of um last letter  concatenation and so it took the inut  question of three words think machine  learning and broke it down into three  sub problems think think machine think  machine learning as the third sub  problem and then you can see in this  bottom panel it solves each one  individually so it shows for example in  green solving the problem think machine  where you can catenate the last letter  of k with the last letter of machine or  last letter think K less machine e can  concatenate those to K and then for the  overall problem taking that solution and  then and basically building on it to get  the overall solution of keg so that's  kind of one concept of decomposing into  sub problems solving them  sequentially now a related work called  IRC or in leap retrieval combines  retrieval with Chain of Thought  reasoning and so you can kind of put  these together into one approach which  you can think of as kind of dynamically  retrieval um to solve a set of sub  problems kind of that retrieval kind of  interleaving with Chain of Thought as  noted in the second paper and a set of  decomposed questions based on your  initial question from the first work  from Google so really the idea here is  we're taking one sub question we're  answering it we're taking that answer  and using it to help answer the second  sub question and so forth so let's  actually just walk through this in code  to show how this might  work so this is The Notebook we've been  working with from some of the other uh  videos you can see we already have a  retriever to find uh up here at the top  and what we're going to do  is we're first going to find a prompt  that's basically going to say given an  input question let's break it down to  set of sub problems or sub question  which can be solved individually so we  can do that and this blog post is  focused on agents so let's ask a  question about what are the main  components of an LM powerered autonomous  agent system so let's run this and  see what the decomposed questions are so  you can see the decomposed questions are  what is LM technology how does it work  um what are components and then how the  components interact so it's kind of a  sane way to kind of break down this  problem into a few sub problems which  you might attack individually now here's  where um we Define a prompt that very  simply is going to take our question  we'll take any prior questions we've  answered and we'll take our retrieval  and basically just combine them and we  can Define this very simple  chain um actually let's go back and make  sure retriever is defined up at the  top so now we are building our  retriever good we have that now so we  can go back down here and let's run this  so  now we are  running and what's happening is we're  trying to solve each of these questions  individually using retrieval and using  any prior question answers so okay very  good looks like that's been done and we  can see here's our answer now let's go  over to langth and actually see what  happened under the hood so here's what's  kind of of interesting and helpful to  see for the first question so here's our  first one it looks like it just does  retrieval which is we expect and then it  uses that to answer this initial  question now for the second question  should be a little bit more interesting  because if you look at our prompt here's  our question now here is our background  available question answer pair so this  was the answer question answer pair from  the first question which we add to our  prompt and then here's the retrieval for  this particular question so we're kind  of building up up the solution because  we're pending the question answer pair  from question one and then likewise with  question three it should combine all of  that so we can look at here here's our  question here's question one here's  question two great now here's additional  retrieval related to this particular  question and we get our final answer so  that's like a really nice way you can  kind of build up Solutions um using this  kind of  interleaved uh retrieval and  concatenating question answer pairs I do  want to mention very briefly that we can  also take a different approach where we  can just answer these all individually  and then just concatenate all those  answers to produce a final answer and  I'll show that really quickly here um  it's like a little bit less interesting  maybe because you're not using answers  from each uh question to inform the next  one you're just answering them all in  parallel this might be better for cases  where it's not really like a sub  question decomposition but maybe it's  like like a set of set of several in  independent questions whose answers  don't depend on each other that might be  relevant for some  problems um and we can go ahead and run  okay so this ran as well we can look at  our  trace and in this  case um yeah we can see that this  actually just kind of concatenates all  of our QA pairs to produce the final  answer so this gives you a sense for how  you can use quer decomposition employ  IDE IDE from uh from two different  papers that are pretty cool thanks hi  this is Lance from Lang chain this is  the fourth video uh in our Deep dive on  queer translation in the rag from  scratch series and we're going to be  focused on step back  prompting so queer translation as we  said in some of the prior videos kind of  sits at the the kind of first stage of  kind of a a a rag pipeline or flow and  the main aim is to take an question and  to translate it or modify in such a way  that it improves  retrieval now we talked through a few  different ways to approach this problem  so one General approach involves  rewriting a question and we talk about  two ways to do that rag fusion  multiquery and again this is this is  really about taking a question and  modifying it to capture a few different  perspectives um which may improve the  retrieval  process now another approach is to take  a question and kind of make it less  abstract like break it down into sub  questions um and then solve each of  those independently so that's what we  saw with like least to most prompting um  and a bunch of other variants kind of in  that in that vein of sub problem solving  and then consolidating those Solutions  into a final  answer now a different approach  presented um by again Google as well is  stepback prompting so stepback prompting  kind of takes the the the opposite  approach where it tries to ask a more  abstract question so the paper talks a  lot  about um using F shot  prompting to produce what they call the  stepback or more abstract questions and  the way it does it is it provides a  number of  examples of stepb back questions given  your original question so like this is  like this is for example they like for  prompt temp  you're an expert World Knowledge I asked  you a question your response should be  comprehensive not contradict with the  following um and this is kind of where  you provide your like original and then  step back so here's like some example um  questions so like um  like uh at year saw the creation of the  region where the country is located  which region of the  country um is the county of of herir  related um Janell was born in what  country what is janell's personal  history so that that's maybe a more  intuitive example so it's like you ask a  very specific question about like the  country someone's born the more abstract  question is like just give me the  general history of this individual  without worrying about that particular  um more specific question um so let's  actually just walk through how this can  be done in practice um so again here's  kind of like a a diagram of uh the  various approaches um from less  abstraction to more  abstraction now here is where we're  formulating our prompt using a few of  the few shot examples from the  paper um so again like input um yeah  something about like the police perform  wful arrests and what what camp members  of the police do so like it it basically  gives the model a few examples um we  basically formulate this into a prompt  that's really all going on here again we  we repeat um this overall prompt which  we saw from the paper your expert World  Knowledge your test is to step back and  paraphrase a question generate more a  generic step back question which is  easier to answer here are some examples  so it's like a very intuitive prompt so  okay let's start with the question what  is Task composition for llm agents and  we're going to say generate stack  question okay so this is pretty  intuitive right what is a process of  task compos I so like not worrying as  much about agents but what is that  process of task composition in general  and then hopefully that can be  independently um retrieved we we can  independently retrieve documents related  to the stepb back question and in  addition retrieve documents related to  the the actual question and combine  those to produce kind of final answer so  that's really all that's going on um and  here's the response template where we're  Plumbing in the stepback context and our  question context and so what we're going  to do here is we're going to take our  input question and perform retrieval on  that we're also going to generate our  stepb back question and perform  retrieval on that we're going to plumb  those into the prompt as here's our very  here's our basically uh our prompt Keys  normal question step back question um  and our overall question again we  formulate those as a dict we Plum those  into our response prompt um and then we  go ahead and attempt to answer our  overall question so we're going to run  that that's  running and okay we have our answer now  I want to hop over to Langs Smith and  attempt to show you um kind of what that  looked like under the hood so let's see  let's like go into each of these steps  so here was our prompt right you're an  expert World Knowledge your test to to  step back and paraph as a question  um so um here were our few shot prompts  and this was our this was our uh stepb  question so what is the process of task  composition um good from the input what  is Tas composition for LM agents we  perform retrieval on both what is  process  composition uh and what is for LM agents  we perform both retrievals we then  populate our prompt with both  uh original question answer and then  here's the context retrieve from both  the question and the stepb back question  here was our final answer so again this  is kind of a nice technique um probably  depends on a lot of the types of like  the type of domain you want to perform  retrieval on um but in some domains  where for example there's a lot of kind  of conceptual knowledge that underpins  questions you expect users to ask this  stepback approach could be really  convenient to automatically formulate a  higher level question um to for example  try to improve retrieval I can imagine  if you're working with like kind of  textbooks or like technical  documentation where you make independent  chapters focused on more highlevel kind  of like Concepts and then other chapters  on like more detailed uh like  implementations this kind of like stepb  back approach and independent retrieval  could be really helpful thanks hi this  is Lance from Lang chain  this is the fifth video focused on queer  translation in our rack from scratch  series we're going to be talking about a  technique called  hide so again queer translation sits  kind of at the front of the overall rag  flow um and the objective is to take an  input question and translate it in some  way that improves  retrieval now hide is an interesting  approach that takes advantage of a very  simple idea the basic rag flow takes a  question and embeds it takes a document  and embeds it and looks for similarity  between an embedded document and  embedded question but questions and  documents are very different text  objects so documents can be like very  large chunks taken from dense um  Publications or other sources whereas  questions are short kind of tur  potentially ill worded from users and  the intuition behind hide is take  questions and map them into document  space using a hypothetical document or  by generating a hypothetical document um  that's the basic intuition and the idea  kind of shown here visually is that in  principle for certain cases a  hypothetical document is closer to a  desired document you actually want to  retrieve in this you know High  dimensional embedding space than the  sparse raw input question itself so  again it's just kind of means of trans  translating raw questions into these  hypothetical documents that are better  suited for  retrieval so let's actually do a Code  walkthrough to see how this works and  it's actually pretty easy to implement  which is really nice so first we're just  starting with a prompt and we're using  the same notebook that we've used for  prior videos we have a blog post on  agents r index um so what we're going to  do is Define a prompt to generate a  hypothetical documents in this case  we'll say write a write a paper passage  uh to answer a given question so let's  just run this and see what happens again  we're taking our prompt piping it to to  open Ai chck gpte and then using string  Opa parer and so here's a hypothetical  document section related to our question  okay and this is derived of course lm's  kind of embedded uh kind of World  Knowledge which is you know a sane place  to generate hypothetical documents now  let's now take that hypothetical  document and basically we're going to  pipe that into a retriever so this means  we're going to fetch documents from our  index related to this hypothetical  document that's been embedded and you  can see we get a few qu a few retrieved  uh chunks that are related to uh this  hypothetical document that's all we've  done um and then let's take the final  step where we take those retrieve  documents here which we  defined and our question we're going to  pipe that into this rag prompt and then  we're going to run our kind of rag chain  right here which you've seen before and  we get our answer so that's really it we  can go to lsmith and we can actually  look at what happened um so here for  example this was our final um rag prompt  answer the following question based on  this context and here is the retrieve  documents that we passed in so that  part's kind of straightforward we can  also look at um okay this is our  retrieval okay now this is this is  actually what we we generated a  hypothetical document here um okay so  this is our hypothetical document so  we've run chat open AI we generated this  passage with our hypothetical document  and then we've run  retrieval here so this is basically  showing hypothetical document generation  followed by retrieval um so again here  was our passage which we passed in and  then here's our retrieve documents from  the retriever which are related to the  passage content so again in this  particular index case it's possible that  the input question was sufficient to  retrieve these documents in fact given  prior examples uh I know that some of  these same documents are indeed  retrieved just from the raw question but  in other context it may not be the case  so folks have reported nice performance  using Hyde uh for certain domains and  the Really convenient thing is that you  can take this this document generation  prompt you can tune this arbitrarily for  your domain of Interest so it's  absolutely worth experimenting with it's  a it's a need approach uh that can  overcome some of the challenges with  retrieval uh thanks very much hi this is  Lance from Lang chain this is the 10th  video in our rack from scratch series  focused on  routing so we talk through query  translation which is the process of  taking a question and translating in  some way it could be decomposing it  using stepback prompting or otherwise  but the idea here was take our question  change it into a form that's better  suited for retrieval now routing is the  next step which is basically routing  that potentially decomposed question to  the right source and in many cases that  could be a different database so let's  say in this toy example we have a vector  store a relational DB and a graph DB the  what we redo with routing is we simply  route the question based upon the cont  of the question to the relevant data  source so there's a few different ways  to do that one is what we call logical  routing in this case we basically give  an llm knowledge of the various data  sources that we have at our disposal and  we let the llm kind of Reason about  which one to apply the question to so  it's kind of like the the LM is applying  some logic to determine you which which  data sour for example to to use  alternatively you can use semantic  routing which is where we take a  question we embed it and for example we  embed prompts we then compute the  similarity between our question and  those prompts and then we choose a  prompt based upon the similarity so the  general idea is in our diagram we talk  about routing to for example a different  database but it can be very general can  be routing to different prompt it can be  you know really arbitrarily taking this  question and sending it at different  places be at different prompts be at  different Vector  stores so let's walk through the code a  little bit so you can see just like  before we've done a few pip installs we  set up lsmith and let's talk through uh  logical routing first so so in this toy  example let's say we had for example uh  three different docs like we had python  docs we had JS docs we had goang docs  what we want to do is take a question  route it to one of those three so what  we're actually doing is we're setting up  a data model which is basically going to  U be bound to our llm and allow the llm  to Output one of these three options as  a structured object so you really think  about this as like  classification classification plus  function calling to produce a structured  output which is constrained to these  three  possibilities so the way we do that is  let's just zoom in here a little bit we  can Define like a structured object that  we want to get out from our llm like in  this case we want for example you know  one of these three data sources to be  output we can take this and we can  actually convert it into open like open  for example function schema  and then we actually pass that in and  bind it to our llm so what happens is we  ask a question our llm invokes this  function on the output to produce an  output that adheres to the schema that  we specify so in this case for example  um we output like you know in this toy  example let's say we wanted like you  know an output to be data source Vector  store or SQL database the output will  contain a data source object and it'll  be you know one of the options we  specify as a Json string we also  instantiate a parser from this object to  parse that Json string to an output like  a pantic object for example so that's  just one toy example and let's show one  up here so in this case again we had our  three doc sources um we bind that to our  llm so you can see we do with structured  output basically under the hood that's  taking that object definition turning  into function schema and binding that  function schema to our llm and we call  our prompt you're an expert at routing a  user question based on you know  programming language um that user  referring to so let's define our router  here now what we're going to do is we'll  ask a question that is python code so  we'll call that and now it's done and  you see the object we get out is indeed  it's a route query object so it's  exactly it aderes to this data model  we've set up and in this case it's it's  it's correct so it's calling this python  doc so you can we can extract that right  here as a string now once we have this  you can really easily set up like a  route so this could be like our full  chain where we take this router we  should defined here and then this choose  route function can basically take that  output and do something with it so for  example if python docs this could then  apply the question to like a retriever  full of python information uh or JS same  thing so this is where you would hook  basically that question up to different  chains that are like you know retriever  chain one for python retriever chain two  for JS and so forth so this is kind of  like the routing mechanism but this is  really doing the heavy lifting of taking  an input question and turning into a  structured object that restricts the  output to one of a few output types that  we care about in our like routing  problem so that's really kind of the way  this all hooks  together now semantic outing is actually  maybe even a little bit more  straightforward based on what we've seen  previously so in that case let's say we  have two prompts we have a physics  prompt we have a math  prompt we can embed those prompts no  problem we do that here now let's say we  have an input question from a user like  in this case what is a black hole we  pass that through we then apply this  runnable Lambda function which is  defined right here what we're doing here  is we're embedding the question we're  Computing similarity between the  question and the prompts uh we're taking  the most similar and then we're  basically choosing the prompt based on  that similarity and you can see let's  run that and try it  out and we're using the physics prompt  and there we go black holes region and  space so that just shows you kind of how  you can use semantic routing uh to  basically embed a question embed for  example various prompts pick the prompt  based on sematic similarity so that  really gives you just two ways to do  routing one is logical routing with  function in uh can be used very  generally in this case we applied it to  like different coding languages but  imagine these could be swapped out for  like you know my python uh my like  vector store versus My Graph DB versus  my relational DB and you could just very  simply have some description of what  each is and you know then not only will  the llm do reasoning but it'll also  return an object uh that can be parsed  very cleanly to produce like one of a  few very specific types which then you  can reason over like we did here in your  routing function so that kind of gives  you the general idea and these are  really very useful tools and I encourage  you to experiment with them  thanks hi this is Lance from Lang chain  this is the 11th part of our rag from  scratch video series focused on query  construction so we previously talked  through uh query translation which is  the process of taking a question and  converting it or translating it into a  question that's better optimized for  retrieval then we talked about routing  which is the process of going taking  that question routing it to the right  Source be it a given Vector store graph  DB um or SQL DB for example now we're  going to talk about the process of query  construction which is basically taking  natural language and converting it into  particular domain specific language uh  for one of these sources now we're going  to talk specifically about the process  of going from natural language to uh  meditated filters for Vector  Stores um the problem statement is  basically this let's imagine we had an  index of Lang Chain video transcripts um  you might want to ask a question give me  you know or find find me videos on chat  Lang chain published after 2024 for  example um the the process of query  structuring basically converts this  natural language question into a  structured query that can be applied to  the metadata uh filters on your vector  store so most Vector stores will have  some kind of meditative filters that can  do kind of structur querying on top of  uh the chunks that are indexed um so for  example this type of query will retrieve  all chunks uh that talk about the topic  of chat Lang chain uh published after  the date 2024 that's kind of the problem  statement and to do this we're going to  use function calling um in this case you  can use for example open AI or other  providers to do that and we're going to  do is at a high level take the metadata  fields that are present in our Vector  store and divide them to the model as  kind of information and the model then  can take those and produce queries that  adhere to the schema provided um and  then we can parse those out to a  structured object like a identic object  which again which can then be used in  search so that's kind of the problem  statement and let's actually walk  through  code um so here's our notebook which  we've kind of gone through previously  and I'll just show you as an example  let's take a example YouTube video and  let's look at the metadata that you get  with the transcript so you can see you  get stuff like description uh URL um  yeah publish date length things like  that now let's say we had an index that  had um basically a that had a number of  different metadata fields and filters uh  that allowed us to do range filtering on  like view count publication date the  video length um or unstructured search  on contents and title so those are kind  of like the imagine we had an index that  had uh those kind of filters available  to us what we can do is capture that  information about the available filters  in an object so we're calling that this  tutorial search object kind of  encapsulates that information about the  available searches that we can do and so  we basically enumerate it here content  search and title search or semantic  searches that can be done over those  fields um and then these filters then  are various types of structure searches  we can do on like the length um The View  count and so forth and so we can just  kind of build that object now we can set  this up really easily with a basic  simple prompt that says you know you're  an expert can bring natural language  into database queries you have access to  the database tutorial videos um given a  question return a database query  optimize retrieval so that's kind of it  now here's the key point though when you  call this LM with structured output  you're binding this pantic object which  contains all the information about our  index to the llm which is exactly what  we talked about previously it's really  this process right here you're taking  this object you're converting it to a  function schema for example open AI  you're binding that to your model and  then you're going to be able to get um  structured object out versus a Json  string from a natural language question  which can then be parsed into a pantic  object which you get out so that's  really the flow and it's taking  advantage of function calling as we said  so if we go back down we set up our  query analyzer chain right here now  let's try to run that just on a on a  purely semantic input so rag from  scratch let's run that and you can see  this just does like a Content search and  a title search that's exactly what you  would expect now if we pass a question  that includes like a date filter let's  just see if that would work  and there we go so you kind of still get  that semantic search um but you also get  um search over for example publish date  earliest and latest publish date kind of  as as you would expect let's try another  one here so videos focus on the topic of  chat Lang chain they're published before  2024 this is just kind of a rewrite of  this question in slightly different way  using a different date filter and then  you can see we can get we get content  search title search and then we can get  kind of a date search so this is a very  general strategy that can be applied  kind of broadly to um different kinds of  querying you want to do it's really the  process of going from an unstructured  input to a structured query object out  following an arbitrary schema that you  provide and so as noted really this  whole thing we created here this  tutorial search is based upon the  specifics of our Vector store of  interest and if you want to learn more  about this I link to some documentation  here that talks a lot about different uh  types of of Integrations we have with  different Vector store providers to do  exactly this so it's a very useful trick  um it allows you to do kind of query uh  uh say metadata filter filtering on the  fly from a natural language question  it's a very convenient trick uh that  works with many different Vector DBS so  encourage you to play with it  thanks this is Lance from Lang chain I'm  going to talk about indexing uh and  mulation indexing in particular for the  12th part of our rag from scratch series  here so we previously talked about a few  different major areas we talk about  query translation which takes a question  and translates it in some way to  optimize for retrieval we talk about  routing which is the process of taking a  question routing it to the right data  source be it a vector store graph DB uh  SQL DB we talked about queer  construction we dug into uh basically  queer construction for Vector stores but  of course there's also text SQL text to  Cipher um so now we're going to talk  about indexing a bit in particular we're  going to talk about indexing indexing  techniques for Vector Stores um and I  want to highlight one particular method  today called multi-representation  indexing so the high LEL idea here is  derived a bit from a paper called  proposition indexing which kind of makes  a simple  observation you can think about  decoupling raw documents and the unit  you use for  retrieval so in the typical case you  take a document you split it up in some  way to index it and then you embed the  split directly  um this paper talks about actually  taking a document splitting it in some  way but then using an llm to produce  what they call a proposition which you  can think of as like kind of a  distillation of that split so it's kind  of like using an llm to modify that  split in some way to distill it or make  it like a crisper uh like summary so to  speak that's better optimized for  retrieval so that's kind of one  highlight one piece of intuition so we  actually taken that idea and we've kind  of built on it a bit in kind of a really  nice way that I think is very well  suited actually for long context llms so  the idea is pretty simple you take a  document and you you actually distill it  or create a proposition like they show  in the prior paper I kind of typically  think of this as just produce a summary  of the document and you embed that  summary so that summary is meant to be  optimized for retrieval so might contain  a bunch of keywords from the document or  like the big  ideas such that when you embed the  summary you embed a question you do  search you basically can find that  document based upon this highly  optimized summary for retrieval so  that's kind of represented here in your  vector store but here's the catch you  independently store the raw document in  a dock store and when you when you  basically retrieve the summary in the  vector store you return the full  document for the llm to perform  generation and this is a nice trick  because at generation time now with long  condex LMS for example the LM can handle  that entire document you don't need to  worry about splitting it or anything you  just simply use the summary to prod like  to create a really nice representation  for fishing out that full dock use that  full dock in generation there might be a  lot of reasons you want to do that you  want to make sure the LM has the full  context to actually answer the question  so that's the big idea it's a nice trick  and let's walk through some code  here we have a notebook all set up uh  just like before we done some pip  installs um set to maybe I Keys here for  lsmith um kind of here's a diagram now  let me show an example let's just load  two different uh blog posts uh one is  about agents one is about uh you know  human data quality um and what we're  going to do is let's create a summary of  each of those so this is kind of the  first step of that process where we're  going from like the raw documents to  summaries let's just have a look and  make sure those ran So Okay cool so the  first DOC discusses you know building  autonomous agents the second doc  contains the importance of high quality  human data and training okay so that's  pretty nice we have our summaries now  we're going to go through a process  that's pretty  simple first we Define a vector store  that's going to index those  summaries now we're going to Define what  we call like our our document storage is  going to store the full documents okay  so this multiv Vector retriever kind of  just pulls those two things together we  basically add our Dock Store we had this  bite store is basically the the the full  document store uh the vector store is  our Vector store um and now this ID is  what we're going to use to reference  between the chunks or the summaries and  the full documents that's really it so  now for every document we'll Define a  new Doc ID um and then we're basically  going to like take our summary documents  um and we're going to extract um for  each of our summaries we're going to get  the associated doc ID so we go um so  let's go ahead and do that so we have  our summary docs which we add to the  vector store we have our full documents  uh our doc IDs and the full raw  documents which are added to our doc  store and then let's just do a query  Vector store like a similarity search on  our Vector store so memory and agents  and we can see okay so we can extract  you know from the summaries we can get  for example the summary that pertains to  um a agents so that's a good thing now  let's go ahead and run a query get  relevant documents on our retriever  which basically combines the summaries  uh which we use for retrieval then the  doc store which we use to get the full  doc back so we're going to apply our  query we're going to basically run this  and here's the key Point we've gotten  back the entire  article um and we can actually if you  want to look at the whole thing we we  can just go ahead and do this here we go  so this is the entire article that we  get back from that search so it's a  pretty nice trick again we query with  just memory and agents um and we can  kind of go back to our diagram here we  quered for memory and agents it started  our summaries it found the summary  related to memory and agents it uses  that doc ID to reference between the  vector store and the doc store it fishes  out the right full doc returns us the  full document in this case the full web  page that's really it simple idea nice  way to go from basically like nice  simple proposition style or summary  style indexing to full document  retrieval which is very useful  especially with long contact LMS thank  you hi this is Lance from Lang chain  this is the 13th part of our rag from  scratch series focused on a technique  called  Raptor so Raptor sits within kind of an  array of different indexing techniques  that can be applied on Vector Stores um  we just talked about  multi-representation indexing um we I  priv a link to a video that's very good  talking about the different means of  chunking so I encourage you to look at  that and we're going to talk today about  a technique called Raptor which you can  kind of think of it as a technique for  hierarchical  indexing so the highle intuition is  this some questions require very  detailed information from a corpus to  answer like pertain to a single document  or single chunk so like we can call  those low-level  questions some questions require  consolidation across kind broad swast of  a document so across like many documents  or many chunks within a document and you  can call those like higher level  questions and so there's kind of this  challenge in retrieval and that  typically we do like K nearest neighbors  retrieval like we've been talking about  you're fishing out some number of chunks  but what if you have a question that  requires information across like five  six you know or a number of different  chunks which may exceed you know the K  parameter in your retrieval so again  when you typically do retrieval you  might set a k parameter of three which  means you're retrieving three chunks  from your vector store um and maybe you  have a high very high level question  that could benefit from infation across  more than three so this technique called  raptor is basically a way to build a  hierarchical index of document summaries  and the intuition is this you start with  a set of documents as your Leafs here on  the left you cluster them and then you  Summarize each cluster so each cluster  of similar documents um will consult  information from across your context  which is you know your context could be  a bunch of different splits or could  even be across a bunch of different  documents you're basically capturing  similar ones and you're consolidating  the information across them in a summary  and here's the interesting thing you do  that  recursively until either you hit like a  limit or you end up with one single  cluster that's a kind of very high level  summary of all of your  documents and what the paper shows is  that if you basically just collapse all  these and index them together as a big  pool you end up with a really nice array  of chunks that span the abstraction  hierarchy like you have a bunch of  chunks from Individual documents that  are just like more detailed chunks  pertaining to that you know single  document but you also have chunks from  these summaries or I would say like you  know maybe not chunks but in this case  the summary is like a distillation so  you know raw chunks on the left that  represent your leavs are kind of like  the rawest form of information either  raw chunks or raw documents and then you  have these higher level summaries which  are all indexed together so if you have  higher level questions they should  basically be more similar uh in sematic  search for example to these higher level  summary chunks if you have lower level  questions then they'll retrieve these  more lower level chunks and so you have  better semantic coverage across like the  abstraction hierarchy of question types  that's the intuition they do a bunch of  nice studies to show that this works  pretty well um I actually did a deep  dive video just on this which I link  below um I did want to cover it briefly  just at a very high level um so let's  actually just do kind of a code walkr  and I've added it to this rack from  scratch course notebook but I link over  to my deep dive video as well as the  paper and the the full code notebook  which is already checked in is discussed  at more length in the Deep dive the  technique is a little bit detailed so I  only want to give you very high levels  kind of overview here and you can look  at the Deep dive video if you want to go  in more depth again we talked through  this abstraction  hierarchy um I applied this to a large  set of Lang chain documents um so this  is me loading basically all of our Lang  chain expression language docs so this  is on the order of 30 documents you can  see I do a histogram here of the token  counts per document some are pretty big  most are fairly small less than you know  4,000 tokens um and what I did is I  indexed all of them um individually so  the all those raw documents you can kind  of Imagine are here on the left and then  I do um I do embedding I do clustering  summarization and I do that recursively  um until I end up with in this case I  believe I only set like three levels of  recursion and then I save them all my  Vector store so that's like the highle  idea I'm applying this Raptor technique  to a whole bunch of Lang chain documents  um that have fairly large number of  tokens um so I do that um and yeah I use  actually use both CLA as well as open AI  here um this talks through the  clustering method which they that they  use which is pretty interesting you can  kind of dig into that on your own if if  you're really um interested this is a  lot of their code um which I cite  accordingly um this is basically  implementing the clustering method that  they use um and this is just simply the  document embedding stage um this is like  basically embedding uh and clustering  that's really it uh some text formatting  um summarizing of the clusters right  here um and then this is just running  that whole process recursively that's  really it um this is tree building so  basically I have the RO the rod docs  let's just go back and look at Doc texts  so this should be all my raw documents  uh so that's right you can see it here  doc text is basically just the text in  all those Lang chain documents that I  pulled  um and so I run this process on them  right  here uh so this is that recursive  embedding cluster basically runs and  produces is that tree here's the results  um this is me just going through the  results and basically adding the result  text to this list of uh texts um oh okay  so here's what I do this Leaf text is  all the raw documents and I'm appending  to that all the summaries that's all  it's going on and then I'm indexing them  all together that's the key Point rag  chain and there you have it that's  really all you do um so anyway I  encourage you to look at this in depth  it's a pretty interesting technique it  works well long with long contexts so  for example one of the arguments I made  is that it's kind of a nice approach to  consult information across like a span  of large  documents like in this particular case  my individual documents were lch  expression language docs uh each each  being somewhere in the order of you know  in this case like you know most of them  are less than 4,000 tokens some pretty  big but I index them all I cluster them  without any splits uh embed them cluster  them build this tree um and go from  there and it all works because we now  have llms that can go out to you know  100 or 200,000 up to million tokens and  Contex so you can actually just do this  process for big swats of documents in  place without any without any splitting  uh it's a pretty nice approach so I  encourage you to think about it look at  it watch the deep that video If you  really want to go deeper on this um  thanks hi this is Lance from Lang chain  this is the 14th part of our rag from  scratch series we're going to I'm going  to be talking about an approach called  cold  bear um so we've talked about a few  different approaches for indexing and  just as kind of a refresher indexing  Falls uh kind of right down here in our  flow we started initially with career  translation taking a question  translating it in some way to optimize  retrieval we talked about routing it to  a particular database we then talked  about query construction so going from  natural language to the DSL or domain  specific language for E any of the  databases that you want to work with  those are you know metadata filters for  Vector stores or Cipher  for graph DB or SQL for relational DB so  that's kind of the flow we talked about  today we talked about some indexing  approaches like multi-representation  indexing we gave a small shout out to  greet camer in the series on chunking uh  we talked about hierarchical indexing  and I want to include one Advanced kind  embedding approach so we talked a lot  about embeddings are obviously very  Central to semantic similarity search um  and  retrieval so one of the interesting  points that's been brought up is that  embedding models of course take a  document you can see here on the top and  embed it basically compress it to a  vector so it's kind of a compression  process you representing all the  semantics of that document in a single  Vector you're doing the same to your  question you're doing similarity search  between the question embedding and the  document embedding um in order to  perform retrieval you're typically  taking the you know K most similar um  document abetting is given a question  and that's really how you're doing it  now a lot of people said well hey the  compressing a full document with all  this Nuance to single Vector seems a  little bit um overly restrictive right  and this is a fair question to ask um  there's been some interesting approaches  to try to address that and one is this  this this approach method called Co bear  so the intuition is actually pretty  straightforward there's a bunch of good  articles I link down here this is my  little cartoon to explain it which I  think is hopefully kind of helpful but  here's the main idea instead of just  taking a document and compressing it  down to a single Vector basically single  uh what we might call embedding Vector  we take the document we break it up into  tokens so tokens are just like you know  units of of content it depends on the  token areas you use we talked about this  earlier so you basically tokenize it and  you produce basically an embedding or  vector for every token and there's some  kind of positional uh waiting that  occurs when you do this process so you  obviously you look to look at the  implementation understand the details  but the intuition is that you're  producing some kind of representation  for every token okay and you're doing  the same thing for your question so  you're taking your question you're  breaking into a tokens and you have some  representation or vector per token  and then what you're doing is for every  token in the question you're Computing  the similarity across all the tokens in  the document and you're finding the max  you're taking the max you're storing  that and you're doing that process for  all the tokens in the question so again  token two you compare it to every token  in the in the document compute the  Max and then the final score is in this  case the sum of the max similarities uh  between every question token and any  document token so it's an interesting  approach uh it reports very strong  performance latency is definitely a  question um so kind of production  Readiness is something you should look  into but it's a it's an approach that's  worth mentioning here uh because it's  pretty  interesting um and let's walk through  the  code  so there's actually nice Library called  rouille which makes it very easy to play  with Co bear um she's pip install it  here I've already done that and we can  use one of their pre-train models to  mediate this process so I'm basically  following their documentation this is  kind of what they recommended um so I'm  running this  now hopefully this runs somewhat quickly  I'm not sure I I previously have loaded  this model so hopefully it won't take  too long and yeah you can see it's  pretty quick uh I'm on a Mac M2 with 32  gigs um so just as like a context in  terms of my my system um this is from  their documentation we're just grabbing  a Wikipedia page this is getting a full  document on Miyazaki so that's cool  we're going to grab that now this is  just from their docs this is basically  how we create an index so we provide the  you know some index name the collection  um the max document length and yeah you  should look at their documentation for  these flags these are just the defaults  so I'm going to create my index um so I  get some logging here so it it's working  under the hood um and by the way I  actually have their documentation open  so you can kind of follow along um  so  um let's see yeah right about here so  you can kind of follow this indexing  process to create an index you need to  load a train uh a trained model this can  be either your own pre-train model or  one of ours from The Hub um and this is  kind of the process we're doing right  now create index is just a few lines of  code and this is exactly what we're  doing um so this is the you know my  documents and this is the indexing step  that we just we just kind of walk  through and it looks like it's done um  so you get a bunch of logging here  that's fine um now let's actually see if  this works so we're going to run drag  search what an emotion Studio did Miaki  found set our K parameter and we get  some results okay so it's running and  cool we get some documents out so you  know it seems to work now what's nice is  you can run this within lighting chain  as a liting chain retriever so that  basically wraps this as a lighting chain  Retriever and then you can use it freely  as a retriever within Lang chain it  works with all the other different LMS  and all the other components like  rankers and so forth that we talk  through so you can use this directly as  a retriever let's try this out and boom  nice and fast um and we get our  documents again this is a super simple  test example you should run this maybe  on more complex cases but it's pretty  pretty easy spin up it's a really  interesting alternative indexing  approach um using again like we talked  through um a very different algorithm  for computing do similarity that may  work better I think an interesting  regime to consider this would be longer  documents so if you want like longer um  yeah if if you basically want kind of  long context embedding I think you  should look into for example the uh Max  token limits for this approach because  it partitions the document into into  each token um I would be curious to dig  into kind of what the overall context  limits are for this approach of coar but  it's really interesting to consider and  it reports very strong performance so  again I encourage you to play with it  and this is just kind of an intro to how  to get set up and to start experimenting  with it really quickly  thanks hi this is Lance from Lang chain  I'm going to be talking about using  langra to build a diverse and  sophisticated rag  flows so just to set the stage the basic  rag flow you can see here starts with a  question retrieval of relevant documents  from an index which are passed into the  context window of an llm for generation  of an answer ground in your documents  that's kind of the basic  outline and we can see it's like a very  linear  path um in practice though you often  encounter a few different types of  questions like when do we actually want  to  retrieve based upon the context of the  question um are the retrieve documents  actually good or not and if they're not  good should we discard them and then how  do we loot back and retry retrieval with  for example and improved  question so these types of questions  motivate an idea of active rag which is  a process where an llm actually decides  when and where to retrieve based upon  like existing  retrievals or existing  Generations now when you think about  this there's a few different levels of  control that you have over an llm in a  rag  application the base case like we saw  with our chain is just use an llm to  choose a single steps output so for  example in traditional rag you feed it  documents and it decides to generation  so it's just kind of one step now a lot  of rag workflows will use the idea of  routing so like given a question should  I route it to a vector store or a graph  DB um and we have seen this quite a  bit now this newer idea that I want to  introduce  is how do we build more sophisticated  logical  flows um in a rag  pipeline um that you let the llm choose  between different steps but specify all  the transitions that are  available and this is known as we call a  state  machine now there's a few different  architectures that have emerged uh to  build different types of rag  chains and of course chains are  traditionally used just for like very  basic rag but this notion of State  machine is a bit newer and Lang graph  which we recently released provides a  really nice way to build State machines  for Rag and for other  things and the general idea here is that  you can lay out more diverse and  complicated rag  flows and then Implement them as graphs  and it kind of motivates this more broad  idea of of like flow engineering and  thinking through the actual like  workflow that you want and then  implementing it um and we're gonna  actually do that right now so I'm GNA Pi  a recent paper called CAG corrective rag  which is really a nice method um for  active rag that incorporates a few  different  ideas um so first you retrieve documents  and then you grade  them now if at least one document  exceeds the threshold for  relevance you go to generation you  generate your  answer um and it does this knowledge  refinement stage after that but let's  not worry about that for right now it's  kind of not essential for understanding  the basic flow here so again you do a  grade for relevance for every document  if any is relevant you  generate now if they're all ambiguous or  incorrect based upon your  grader you retrieve from an external  Source they use web  search and then they pass that as their  context for answer  generation so it's a really neat  workflow where you're doing retrieval  just like with basic rag but then you're  reasoning about the documents if they're  relevant go ahead and at least one is  relevant go ahead and generate if  they're not retrieve from alternative  source and then pack that into the  context and generate your  answer so let's see how we would  implement this as a estate machine using  Lang  graph um we'll make a few  simplifications  um we're going to first decide if any  documents are relevant we'll go ahead  and do the the web search  um to supplement the output so that's  just like kind of one minor  modification um we'll use tab search for  web search um we use Query writing to  optimize the search for uh to optimize  the web search but it follows a lot of  the the intuitions of the main paper uh  small note here we set the Tav API key  and another small mode I've already set  my lsmith API key um with which we'll  see is useful a bit later for observing  the resulting  traces now I'm going to index three blog  posts that I  like um I'm going to use chroma DB I'm G  use open ey embeddings I'm going to run  this right now this will create a vector  store for me from these three blog  posts and then what I'm going to do is  Define  State now this is kind of the core  object that going to be passed around my  graph that I'm going to  modify and right here is where I Define  it and the key point to note right now  is it's just a dictionary and it can  contain things that are relevant for rag  like question documents generation and  we'll see how we update that in in in a  little bit but the first thing to note  is we Define our state and this is  what's going to be modified in every Noe  of our  graph now here's really the Crux of it  and this is the thing I want to zoom in  on a little bit um  so when you kind of move from just  thinking about promps to thinking about  overall flows it it's like kind of a fun  and interesting exercise I kind of think  about this as it's been mentioned on  Twitter a little bit more like flow  engineering so let's think through what  was actually done in the paper and what  modifications to our state are going to  happen in each stage so we start with a  question you can see that on the far  left and this kind of state is represent  as a dictionary like we have we start  with a question we perform retrieval  from our Vector store which we just  created that's going to give us  documents so that's one node we made an  an adjustment to our state by adding  documents that's step  one now we have a second node where  we're going to grade the documents and  in this node we might filter some out so  we are making a modification to state  which is why it's a node so we're going  to have a  greater then we're going to have what  we're going to call a conditional Edge  so we saw we went from question to  retrieval retrieval always goes to  grading and now we have a  decision if any document is  irrelevant we're going to go ahead and  do web search to  supplement and if they're all relevant  will go to generation it's a minor kind  of a minor kind of logical uh decision  ision that we're going to  make um if any are not relevant we'll  transform the query and we'll do web  search and we'll use that for Generation  so that's really it and that's how we  can kind of think about our flow and how  our States can be modified throughout  this  flow now all we then need to do and I I  kind of found  spending 10 minutes thinking carefully  through your flow  engineering is really valuable because  from here it's really implementation  details um and it's pretty easy as  you'll see so basically I'm going to run  this code block but then we can like  walk through some of it I won't show you  everything so it'll get a little bit  boring but really all we're doing is  we're finding functions for every node  that take in the state and modify in  some way that's all it's going on so  think about retrieval we run retrieval  we take in state remember it's a dict we  get our state dick like this  we extract one keyy question from our  dick we pass that to a retriever we get  documents and we write back out State  now with documents key added that's  all generate going to be similar we take  in state now we have our question and  documents we pull in a prompt we Define  an llm we do minor post processing on  documents we set up a chain for  retrieval uh or sorry for Generation  which is just going to be take our  prompt pump Plum that to an llm  partially output a string and we run it  right here invoking our documents in our  question to get our answer we write that  back to State that's  it and you can kind of follow here for  every node we just Define a function  that performs the state modification  that we want to do on that  node grading documents is going to be  the same um in this case I do a little  thing extra here because I actually  Define a identic data model for my  grader so that the output of that  particular grading chain is a binary yes  or no you can look at the code make sure  it's all shared um and that just makes  sure that our output is is very  deterministic so that we then can down  here perform logical filtering so what  you can see here is um we Define this  search value no and we iterate through  our documents we grade them if any  document uh is graded as not relevant we  flag this search thing to yes that means  we're going to perform web search we  then add that to our state dict at the  end so run web search now that value is  true that's  it and you can kind of see we go through  some other nodes here there's web search  node um now here is where our one  conditional Edge we Define right here  this is where where we decide to  generate or not based on that search key  so we again get our state let's extract  the various values so we have this  search value now if search is yes we  return the next no that we want to go to  so in this case it'll be transform query  which will then go to web search else we  go to  generate so what we can see is we laid  out our graph which you can kind of see  up  here and now we Define functions for all  those nodes as well as the conditional  Edge and now we scroll down all we have  to do is just lay that out here again as  our flow and this is kind of what you  might think of as like kind of flow  engineering where you're just laying out  the graph as you drew it where we have  set our entry point as retrieve we're  adding an edge between retrieve and  grade documents so we went retrieval  grade documents we add our conditional  Edge depending on the grade either  transform the query go to web search or  just go to generate we create an edge  between transform the query and web  search then web search to generate and  then we also have an edge generate to  end and that's our whole graph that's it  so we can just run  this and now I'm going to ask a question  so let's just say um how does agent  memory work for example let's just try  that and what this is going to do is  going to print out what's going on as we  run through this graph so um first we  going to see output from  retrieve this is going to be all of our  documents that we retrieved so that's  that's fine this just from our our  retriever then you can see that we're  doing a relevance check across our  documents and this is kind of  interesting right you can see we grading  them here one is grade as not  relevant um and okay you can see the  documents are now filtered because we  removed the one that's not relevant and  because one is not relevant we decide  okay we're going to just transform the  query and run web  search and um you can see after query  transformation we rewrite the question  slightly we then run web  search um and you can see from web  search it searched from some additional  sources um which you can actually see  here it's  appended as a so here it is so here it's  a new document appended from web search  which is from memory knowledge  requirements so it it basically looked  up some AI architecture related to  memory uh web results so that's fine  that's exactly what we want to  do and then um we generate a  response so that's great and this is  just showing you everything in kind of  gory detail but I'm going to show you  one other thing that's that's really  nice about this if I go to lsmith  I have my AP I ke set so all my  Generations are just logged to to lsmith  and I can see my Lang graph run here now  what's really cool is this shows me all  of my nodes so remember we had retrieve  grade we evaluated the grade because one  was irrelevant we then went ahead and  transformed the query we did a web  search we pended that to our context you  can see all those steps are laid out  here in fact you can even look at every  single uh grader and its output I will  move this up  slightly um so you can see the the  different scores for grades okay so this  particular retrieval was graded as as  not relevant so that's fine that that  can happen in some cases and because of  that um we did a query transformation so  we modified the question slightly how  does memory how does the memory system  an artificial agents function so it's  just a minor rephrasing of the question  we did this Tav web search this is where  it queried from this particular blog  post from medium so it's like a sing web  query we can like sanity check it and  then what's need is we can go to our  generate step look at open Ai and here's  our full prompt how does the memory  system in our official agents function  and then here's all of our documents so  this is the this is the web search as  well as we still have the Rel chunks  that were retrieved from our blog posts  um and then here's our answer so that's  really it you can see how um really  moving from the notion of just like I'll  actually go back to the original um  moving  from uh I will try to open this up a  little  bit um  yeah I can see my face  still um the transition from laying out  simple  chains to  flows is a really interesting and  helpful way of thinking about why graphs  are really interesting because you can  encode more sophisticated logical  reasoning  workflows but in a  very like clean and well-engineered way  where you can specify all the  transitions that you actually want to  have  executed um and I actually find this way  of thinking and building kind of logical  uh like workflows really  intuitive um we have a blog post coming  out uh tomorrow that discusses both  implementing self rag as well as C rag  for two different active rag approaches  using using uh this idea of of State  machines and Lang graph um so I  encourage you to play with it uh I found  it really uh intuitive to work with um I  also found uh inspection of traces to be  quite intuitive using Lang graph because  every node is enumerated pretty clearly  for you which is not always the case  when you're using other types of of more  complex reasoning approaches for example  like agents so in any case um I hope  this was helpful and I definitely  encourage you to check out um kind of  this notion of like flow engineering  using Lang graph and in the context of  rag it can be really powerful hopefully  as you've seen here thank  you hey this is Lance from Lang chain I  want to talk to a recent paper that I  saw called adaptive rag which brings  together some interesting ideas that  have kind of been covered in other  videos but this actually ties them all  together in kind of a fun way so the the  two big ideas to talk about here are one  of query analysis so we've actually done  kind of a whole rag from scratch series  that walks through each of these things  in detail but this is a very nice  example of how this comes together um  with some other ideas we've been talking  about so query analysis is typically the  process of taking an input question and  modifying in some way uh to better  optimize retrieval there's a bunch of  different methods for this it could be  decomposing it into sub questions it  could be using some clever techniques  like stepb back prompting um but that's  kind of like the first stage of query  analysis then typically you can do  routing so you route a question to one  of multiple potential sources it could  be one or two different Vector stores it  could be relational DB versus Vector  store it could be web search it could  just be like an llm fallback right so  this is like one kind of big idea query  analysis right it's kind of like the  front end of your rag pipeline it's  taking your question it's modifying it  in some way it's sending it to the right  place be it a web search be it a vector  store be it a relational DB so that's  kind of topic one now topic two is  something that's been brought up in a  few other videos um of what I kind of  call Flow engineering or adaptive rag  which is the idea of doing tests in your  rag pipeline or in your rag inference  flow uh to do things like check  relevance documents um check whether or  not the answer contains hallucinations  so this recent blog post from Hamil  Hussein actually covers evaluation in in  some really nice detail and one of the  things he highlighted  explicitly is actually this topic so he  talks about unit tests and in particular  he says something really interesting  here he says you know unlike typical  unit tests you want to organize these  assertions in places Beyond typical unit  testing such as data cleaning and here's  the key Point automatic retries during  model inference that's the key thing I  want to like draw your attention to to  it's a really nice approach we've talked  about some other papers that do that  like corrective rag self rag but it's  also cool to see it here and kind of  encapsulated in this way the main idea  is that you're using kind of unit tests  in your flow to make Corrections like if  your retrieval is bad you can correct  from that if your generation has  hallucinations you can correct from that  so I'm going to kind of draw out like a  cartoon diagram of what we're going to  do here and you can kind of see it here  we're starting with a question we talked  about query analysis we're going to take  our question and we're going to decide  where it needs to go and for this  particular toy example I'm going to say  either send it to a vector store send it  to web search or just have the llm  answer it right so that's like kind of  my fallback  Behavior then we're going to bring in  that idea of kind of online flow  engineering or unit testing where I'm  going to have my retrieval either from  the VOR store or web search I'm then  going to ask is this actually relevant  to the question if it isn't I'm actually  going to kick back to web sech so this  is a little bit more relevant in the  case if I've routed to to the vector  store done retrieval documents aren't  relevant I'll have a fallback  mechanism um then I'm going to generate  I check for hallucinations in my  generation and then I check for um for  whether or not the the generation  actually answers the question then I  return my answer so again we're tying  together two ideas one is query analysis  like basically taking a question routing  it to the right place modifying it as  needed and then kind of online unit  testing and iterative flow  feedback so to do this I've actually  heard a lot of people talk online about  command r a new model release from gooh  here it has some pretty nice properties  that I was kind of reading about  recently so one it has nice support for  Tool use and it does support query  writing in the context of tool use uh so  this all rolls up in really nice  capabilities for routing it's kind of  one now two it's small it's 35 billion  parameter uh it's actually open weight  so you can actually run this locally and  I've tried that we can we can talk about  that later uh so and it's also fast  served via the API so it's kind of a  small model and it's well tuned for rag  so I heard a lot of people talking about  using coher for Rag and it has a large  context 120,000 tokens so this like a  nice combination of properties it  supports to and routing it's small and  fast so it's like quick for grading and  it's well tuned for rag so it's actually  a really nice fit for this particular  workflow where I want to do query  analysis and routing and I want to do  kind of online checking uh and rag so  kind of there you go now let's just get  to the coding bit so I have a notebook  kind of like usual I've done a few pip  installs you can see it's nothing exotic  I'm bringing Lang chain coh here I set  my coher API key now I'm just going to  set this Lang chain project within  lsmith so all my traces for this go to  that project and I have enabled tracing  so I'm using Langs Smith here so we're  going to walk through this flow and  let's do the first thing let's just  build a vector store so I'm going to  build a vector store using coherent  beddings with chroma open source Vector  DB runs locally from three different web  pages on blog post that I like so it  pertains to agents prompt engineering  and adversarial attacks so now I have a  retriever I can run retriever invoke and  I can ask a question about you know  agent  memory agent  memory and there we go so we get  documents back so there we go we have a  retriever now now here's where I'm going  to bring in coh here I also want a  router so you look at our flow the first  step is this routing stage right so what  I'm going to do is I'm guess we going to  find two tools a web search tool and a  vector store tool okay in my Preamble is  just going to say you're an expert  routing user questions to Vector store  web search now here's the key I tell it  what the vector store has so again my  index my Vector store has agents prompt  engineering adial tax I just repeat that  here agents prompt adversarial tax so it  knows what's in the vector store um so  use it for questions on these topics  otherwise use web search so that's it I  use command R here now I'm going to bind  these tools to the model and attach the  Preamble and I have a structured LM  router so let's give it a let's give  this a few tests just to like kind of  sandbox this a little bit  so I can inval here's my chain I have a  router prompt I pass that to the  structured LM router which I defined  right here and um let's ask a few  different questions like who will the  Bears draft in the NFL draft with types  of agent memory and Hi how are you so  I'm going to kick that off and you can  see you know it does web search it does  it goes to Vector store and then  actually returns this false so that's  kind of interesting um this is actually  just  saying if it does not use either tool so  for that particular query web search or  the vector store was inappropriate it'll  just say hey I didn't call one of those  tools so that's interesting we'll use  that later so that's my router tool now  the second thing is my grader and here's  where I want to show you something  really nice that is generally useful uh  for many different problems you might  encounter so here's what I'm doing I'm  defining a data model uh for My Grade so  basically grade documents it's going to  have this is a pantic object it is just  basically a binary score here um field  specified here uh documents are relevant  to the question yes no I have a preamble  your grer assessing relevance of  retrieve documents to a user question um  blah blah blah so you know and then  basically give it a b score yes no I'm  using command R but here's the catch I'm  using this wi structured outputs thing  and I'm passing my grade documents uh  data model to that that so this is the  key thing we can test this right now as  well it's going to return an object  based on the schema I give it which is  extremely useful for all sorts of use  cases and let's actually Zoom back up so  we're actually right here so this  greater stage right I want to constrain  the output to yes no I don't want any  preambles I want anything because the  logic I'm going to build in this graph  is going to require a yes no binary  response from this particular Edge in  our graph  so that's why this greater tool is  really  useful and I'm asking like a mock  question types of agent memory I do a  retriever I do a retrieval from our  Vector store I get the tuck and I test  it um I invoke our greater retrieval  grater chain with the question the doc  text and it's relevant as we would  expect so that's good but again let's  just kind of look at that a little bit  more closely what's actually happening  under the hood here here's the pantic  object we passed  here's the document in question I'm  providing basically it's converting this  object into coher function schema it's  binding that to the  llm we pass in the document question it  returns an object basic a Json string  per our pantic schema that's it and then  it's just going to like parse that into  a pantic object which we get at the end  of the day so that's what's happening  under the hood with this with structured  output thing but it's extremely useful  and you'll see we're going to use that a  few different places um um because we  want to ensure that in our in our flow  here we have three different grading  steps and each time we want to constrain  the output to yes no we're going to use  that structured output more than  once um this is just my generation so  this is good Old Rag let's just make  sure that works um I'm using rag chain  typical rag prompt again I'm using  cohere for rag pretty easy and yeah so  the rag piece works that's totally fine  nothing to it crazy there um I'm going  to find this llm fallback so this is  basically if you saw a router chain if  it doesn't use a tool I want to fall  back and just fall back to the llm so  I'm going to kind of build that as a  little chain here so okay this is just a  fallback I have my Preamble just you're  you're an assistant answer the question  based upon your internal knowledge so  again that fallback behavior is what we  have here so what we've done already is  we defined our router piece we've  defined our our basic retrieval our  Vector store we already have here um  we've defined our first logic or like  grade check and we defined our fallback  and we're just kind of roll through the  parts of our graph and Define each piece  um so I'm going to have two other  graders and they're going to use the  same thing we just talked about slightly  different data model I mean same output  but actually just slightly different uh  prompt um and you know descript destion  this in this case is the aners grounded  the facts yes no this is my  hallucination  grater uh and then I have an answer  grader as well and I've also run a test  on each one and you can see I'm getting  binary this this these objects out have  a binary score so this a pantic object  with a binary score uh and that's  exactly what we want cool  and I have a Search tool so that's  really nice we've actually gone through  and we've kind of laid out I have like a  router I've tested it we have a vector  story tested we've tested each of our  graders here we've also tested  generation of just doing rag so we have  a bunch of pieces built here we have a  fallback piece we have web search now  the question is how do I Stitch these  together into this kind of flow and for  that I I like to use Lang graph we'll  talk a little about Lang graph versus  agents a bit later but I want to show  you why this is really easy to do using  Lang graph so what's kind of nice is  I've kind of laid out all my logic here  we've tested individually and now all  I'm going to do  is I'm going to first lay out uh the  parts of my graph so what you're going  to notice here is first there's a graph  state so this state represents kind of  the key parts of the graph or the key  kind of objects within the graph that  we're going to be modifying so this is  basically a graph centered around rag  we're going to have question generation  and documents that's really kind of the  main things we're going to be working  with in our  graph so then you're going to see  something that's pretty intuitive I  think what you're going to see is we're  going to basically walk through this  flow and for each of these little  circles we're just going to find a  function and these uh little squares or  these these you can think about every  Circle as a node and every kind of  diamond here as as an edge or  conditional Edge so that's actually what  we're going to do right now we're going  to lay out all of our nodes and edges  and each one of them are just going to  be a function and you're going to see  how we do that right now so I'm going to  go down here I def find my graph state  so this is what's going to be kind of  modified and propagated throughout my  graph now all I'm going to do is I'm  just going to find a function uh for  each of those nodes so let me kind of go  side by side and show you the diagram  and then like kind of show the nodes  next to it so here's the  diagram so we have uh a retrieve node so  that kind of represents our Vector store  we have a fallback node that's this  piece we have a generate node so that's  basically going to do our rag you can  see there we have a grade documents node  kind of right  here um and we have a web search node so  that's right here cool now here's where  we're actually to find the edges so you  can see our edges are the pieces of the  graph that are kind of making different  decisions so this route question Edge  basic conditional Edge is basically  going to take an input question and  decide where it needs to go and that's  all we're doing down here it kind of  follows what we did up at the top where  we tested this individually so recall we  basically just invoke that question  router returns our source now remember  if tool calls were not in the source we  do our fall back so we show actually  showed that all the way up here remember  this if tool calls is not in the  response this thing will just be false  so that means we didn't either we didn't  call web search and we didn't call uh  our retriever tool so then we're just  going to fall  back  um yep right here and this is just like  uh you know a catch just in case a tool  could make a decision but most  interestingly here's where we choose a  data source basically so um this is the  output of our tool call we're just going  to fish out the name of the tool so  that's data source and then here we go  if the data source is web search I'm  returning web search as basically the  next node to go to um otherwise if it's  Vector store we return Vector store as  the next node to go to so what's this  search thing well remember we right up  here Define this node web search that's  it we're just going to go to that node  um what's this Vector store um you'll  see below how we can kind of tie these  strings that we returned from the  conditional Edge to the node we want to  go to that's really it um same kind of  thing here decide to generate that's  going to roll in these two conditional  edges into one um and basically it's  going to do if there's no documents so  basic basically if we filtered out all  of our documents from this first test  here um then what we're going to do is  we've decided all documents are not  relevant to the question and we're going  to kick back to web search exactly as we  show here so that's this piece um  otherwise we're going to go to generate  so that's this piece so again in these  conditional edges you're basically  implementing the logic that you see in  our diagram right here that's all that's  going on um and again this is just  implementing the final two checks uh for  hallucinations and and answer  relevance um  and um yep so here's our hallucination  grader we then extract the grade if the  if basically there are  hallucinations um oh sorry in this case  the grade actually yes means that the  answer is grounded so we say answer is  actually grounded and then we go to the  next step we go to the next test that's  all this is doing it's just basically  wrapping this logic that we're  implementing here in our graph so that's  all that's going on and let's go ahead  and Define all those things so nice we  have all that um now we can actually go  down a little bit and we can pull  um this is actually where we stitch  together everything so all it's  happening here is you see we defined all  these functions up here we just add them  as nodes in our graph here and then we  build our graph here basically by by  basically laying out the flow or the  connectivity between our nodes and edges  so you know you can look at this  notebook to kind of study in a bit of  detail what's going on but frankly what  I like to do here typically just draw  out a graph kind of like we did up  here and then Implement uh the Lo  logical flow here in your graph as nodes  and edges just like we're doing here  that's all that's happening uh so again  we have like our entry point is the  router  um this is like the output is this is  basically directing like here's what the  router is outputting and here's the next  node to go to so that's it um and then  for each node we're kind of applying  like we're saying like what's what's the  flow so web search goes to generate  after um and retrieve goes to grade  documents grade documents um kind of is  is like is a conditional Edge um  depending on the results we either do  web search or generate and then our  second one we go from generate to uh  basically this grade uh generation  versus documents in question based on  the output of that we either have  hallucinations we regenerate uh we found  that the answer is not useful we kick  back to web search or we end um finally  we have that llm fallback and that's  also if we go to the fallback we end so  what you're seeing here is actually the  the logic flow we're laying out in this  graph matches the diagram  that we laid out up top I'm just going  to copy these over and I'll actually go  then back to the diagram and and kind of  underscore that a little bit more so  here is the flow we've laid out again  here is our diagram and you can kind of  look at them side by side and see how  they basically match up so here's kind  of our flow diagram going from basically  query analysis that's this thing this  route question and you can see web  search Vector store LM fallback LM  fallback web search vector store so  those are like the three options that  can come out of this conditional Edge  and then here's where we connect so if  we go to web search then basically we  next go to  generate so that's kind of this whole  flow um now if we go to  retrieve um then we're going to grade so  that's  it um and you know it follows kind of as  you can see here that's really it uh so  it's just nice to draw the these  diagrams out first and then it's pretty  quick to implement each node and each  Edge just as a function and then stitch  them together in a graph just like I  show here and of course we'll make sure  this code's publ so you can use it as a  reference um so there we go now let's  try a few a few different test questions  so like what player the Bears to draft  and NFL draft right let's have a look at  that and they should print everything  it's doing as we go so okay this is  important route question it just decides  to route to web search that's good it  doesn't go to our Vector store this is a  current event not related to our Vector  store at all it goes to web search um  and then it goes to generate so that's  what we'd expect so basically web search  goes through to generate  um and we check hallucinations  Generations ground the documents we  check generation versus question the  generation addresses the question the  Chicago Bears expected to draft Caleb  Williams that's right that's that's the  consensus so cool that works now let's  ask a question related to our Vector  store what are the types of agent memory  we'll kick this off so we're routing  okay we're routing to rag now look how  fast this is that's really fast so we  basically whip through that document  grading determine they're all relevant  uh we go to decision to  generate um we check hallucinations we  check answer versus question and there  are several types of memory stored in  the human brain memory can also be  stored in G of Agents you have LM agents  memory stream retrieval model and and  reflection mechanism so it's  representing what's captured on the blog  post pretty reasonably now let me show  you something else is kind of nice I can  go to Langs Smith and I can go to my  projects we create this new project  coher adaptive rag at the start and  everything is actually logged there  everything we just did so I can open  this up and I can actually just kind of  look through all the stages of my Lang  graph to here's my retrieval stage um  here's my grade document stage and we  can kind of audit the grading itself we  kind of looked at this one by one  previously but it's actually pretty nice  we can actually audit every single  individual document grade to see what's  happening um we can basically go through  um to this is going to be one of the  other graders here  um yep so this is actually going to be  the hallucination grading right here uh  and then this is going to be the answer  grading right here so that's really it  you can kind of walk through the entire  graph you can you can kind of study  what's going on um which is actually  very useful so it looks like this worked  pretty well um and finally let's just  ask a question that should go to that  fallback uh path down at the bottom like  not related at all to our Vector store  current events and yeah hello I'm doing  well so it's pretty neat we've seen in  maybe 15 minutes we've from scratch  built basically a semi- sophisticated  rag system that has agentic properties  we've done in Lang graph we've done with  coher uh command R you can see it's  pretty darn fast in fact we can go to  Langs Smith and look at so this whole  thing took 7 seconds uh that is not bad  let's look at the most recent one so  this takes one second so the fallback  mechanism to the LM is like 1 second um  the let's just look here so 6 seconds  for the initial uh land graph so this is  not bad at all it's quite fast it done  it does quite a few different checks we  do routing uh and then we have kind of a  bunch of nice fallback behavior and  inline checking uh for both relevance  hallucinations and and answer uh kind of  groundedness or answer usefulness so you  know this is pretty nice I definitely  encourage you to play with a notebook  command R is a really nice option for  this due to the fact that is tool use  routing uh small and quite fast and it's  really good for Rags it's a very nice  kind of uh a very nice option for  workflows like this and I think you're  going to see more and more of this kind  of like uh adaptive or self-reflective  rag um just because this is something  that a lot systems can benefit from like  a a lot of production rack systems kind  of don't necessarily have  fallbacks uh depending on for example  like um you know if the documents  retrieved are not relevant uh if the  answer contains hallucinations and so  forth so this opportunity to apply  inline checking along with rag is like a  really nice theme I think we're going to  see more and more of especially as model  inference gets faster and faster and  these checks get cheaper and cheaper to  do kind of in the inference Loop  now as a final thing I do want to bring  up the a point about you know we've  shown this Lang graph stuff what about  agents you know how do you think about  agents versus Lang graph right and and I  think the way I like to frame this is  that um Lang graph is really good  for um flows that you have kind of very  clearly defined that don't have like  kind of open-endedness but like in this  case we know the steps we want to take  every time we want to do um basically  query analysis routing and then we want  to do a three grading steps and that's  it um Lang graph is really good for  building very reliable flows uh it's  kind of like putting an agent on guard  rails and it's really nice uh it's less  flexible but highly reliable and so you  can actually use smaller faster models  with langra so that's the thing I like  about we saw here command R 35 billion  parameter model works really well with  langra quite quick we' were able to  implement a pretty sophisticated rag  flow really quickly 15 minutes um in  time is on the order of like less than  you know around 5 to 6 seconds so so  pretty good right now what about agents  right so I think Agents come into play  when you want more flexible workflows  you don't want to necessarily follow a  defined pattern a priori you want an  agent to be able to kind of reason and  make of open-end decisions which is  interesting for certain like long  Horizon planning problems you know  agents are really  interesting the catch is that  reliability is a bit worse with agents  and so you know that's a big question a  lot of people bring up and that's kind  of where larger LMS kind of come into  play with a you know there's been a lot  of questions about using small LMS even  open source models with agents and  reliabilities kind of continuously being  an issue whereas I've been able to run  these types of land graphs with um with  uh like mraw or you know command R  actually is open weights you can run it  locally um I've been able to run them  very reproducibly with open source  models on my laptop um so you know I  think there's a tradeoff and Comm  actually there's a new coher model  coming out uh believe command R plus  which uh is a larger model so it's  probably more suitable for kind of more  open-ended agentic use cases and there's  actually a new integration with Lang  chain that support uh coher agents um  which is quite nice so I think it's it's  worth experimenting for certain problems  in workflows you may need more  open-ended reasoning in which case use  an agent with a larger model otherwise  you can use like Lang graph for more uh  a more reliable potential  but con strain flow and it can also use  smaller models faster LMS so those are  some of the trade-offs to keep in mind  but anyway encourage you play with a  notebook explore for yourself I think  command R is a really nice model um I've  also been experimenting with running it  locally with AMA uh currently the  quantise model is like uh two bit  quantise is like 13 billion uh or so uh  yeah 13 gigs it's it's a little bit too  large to run quickly locally for me  um inference for things like rag we're  on the order of 30 seconds so again it's  not great for a live demo but it does  work it is available on a llama so I  encourage you to play with that I have a  Mac M2 32 gig um so you know if I if  you're a larger machine then it  absolutely could be worth working with  locally so encourage you to play with  that anyway hopefully this was useful  and interesting I think this is a cool  paper cool flow um coher command R is a  nice option for these types of like  routing uh it's quick good with Lang  graph good for rag good for Tool use so  you know have a have a look and uh you  know reply anything uh any feedback in  the comments  thanks hi this is Lance from Lang chain  this is a talk I gave at two recent  meetups in San Francisco called is rag  really dead um and I figured since you  know a lot of people actually weren't  able to make those meetups uh I just  record this and put this on YouTube and  see if this is of interest to folks um  so we all kind of recognize that Contex  windows are getting larger for llms so  on the x-axis you can see the tokens  used in pre-training that's of course  you know getting larger as well um  proprietary models are somewhere over  the two trillion token regime we don't  quite know where they sit uh and we've  all the way down to smaller models like  52 trained on far fewer tokens um but  what's really notable is on the y axis  you can see about a year ago da the art  models were on the order of 4,000 to  8,000 tokens and that's you know dozens  of pages um we saw Claude 2 come out  with the 200,000 token model earlier I  think it was last year um gbd4 128,000  tokens now that's hundreds of pages and  now we're seeing Claud 3 and Gemini come  out with million token models so this is  hundreds to thousands of pages so  because of this phenomenon people have  been kind of wondering is rag dead if  you can stuff you know many thousands of  pages into the context window llm why do  you need a reteval system um it's a good  question spoke sparked a lot of  interesting debate on Twitter um and  it's maybe first just kind of grounding  on what is rag so rag is really the  process of reasoning and retrieval over  chunks of of information that have been  retrieved um it's starting with you know  documents that are indexed um they're  retrievable through some mechanism  typically some kind of semantic  similarity search or keyword search  other mechanisms  retriev docs should then pass to an llm  and the llm reasons about them to ground  response to the question in the retrieve  document so that's kind of the overall  flow but the important point to make is  that typically it's multiple documents  and involve some form of  reasoning so one of the questions I  asked recently is you know if long  condex llms can replace rag it should be  able to perform you know multia  retrieval and reasoning from its own  context really effectively so I teamed  up with Greg Cameron uh to kind of  pressure test this and he had done some  really nice needle the Haack analyses  already focused on kind of single facts  called needles placed in a Hy stack of  Paul Graham essays um so I kind of  extended that to kind of mirror the rag  use case or kind of the rag context uh  where I took multiple facts so I call it  multi needle um I buil on a funny needle  in the HTO challenge published by  anthropic where they add they basically  placed Pizza ingredients in the context  uh and asked the LM to retrieve this  combination of pizza ingredients I did I  kind of Rift on that and I basically  split the pizza ingredients up into  three different needles and place those  three ingredients in different places in  the context and then ask the um to  recover those three ingredients um from  the context so again the setup is the  question is what the secret ingredients  need to build a perfect Pizza the  needles are the ingredients figs Pudo  goat cheese um I place them in the  context at some specified intervals the  way this test works is you can basically  set the percent of context you want to  place the first needle and the remaining  two are placed at roughly equal  intervals in the remaining context after  the first so that's kind of the way the  test is set up now it's all open source  by the way the link is below so needs  are placed um you ask a question you  promp L them with with kind of um with  this context and the question and then  produces the answer and now the the  framework will grade the response  both one are you know all are all the  the specified ingredients present in the  answer and two if not which ones are  missing so I ran a bunch of analysis on  this with GPD 4 and came kind of came up  with some with some fun results um so  you can see on the left here what this  is looking at is different numbers of  needles placed in 120,000 token context  window for  gbd4 and I'm asking um gbd4 to retrieve  either one three or 10 needles now I'm  also asking it to do reasoning on those  needles that's what you can see in those  red bars so green is just retrieve the  ingredients red is reasoning and the  reasoning challenge here is just return  the first letter of each ingredient so  we find is basically two things the  performance or the percentage of needles  retrieved drops with respect to the  number of needles that's kind of  intuitive you place more facts  performance gets worse but also it gets  worse if you ask it to reason so if you  say um just return the needles it does a  little bit better than if you say return  the needles and tell me the first letter  so you overlay reasoning so this is the  first observation more facts is harder  uh and reasoning is harder uh than just  retrieval now the second question we ask  is where are these needles actually  present in the context that we're  missing right so we know for example um  retrieval of um 10 needles is around 60%  so where are the missing needles in the  context so on the right you can see  results telling us actually which  specific needles uh are are the model  fails to retrieve so what we can see is  as you go from a th000 tokens up to  120,000 tokens on the X here and you  look at needle one place at the start of  the document to needle 10 placed at the  end at a th000 token context link you  can retrieve them all so again kind of  match what we see over here small well  actually sorry over here everything I'm  looking at is 120,000 tokens so that's  really not the point uh the point is  actually smaller context uh better  retrieval so that's kind of point one um  as I increase the context window I  actually see that uh there is increased  failure to retrieve needles which you  see can see in red here towards the  start of the  document um and so this is an  interesting result um and it actually  matches what Greg saw with single needle  case as well so the way to think about  it is it appears that um you know if you  for example read a book and I asked you  a question about the first chapter you  might have forgotten it same kind of  phenomenon appears to happen here with  retrieval where needles towards the  start of the context are are kind of  Forgotten or are not well retrieved  relative to those of the end so this is  an effect we see with gbd4 it's been  reproduced quite a bit so ran nine  different trials here Greg's also seen  this repeatedly with single needle so it  seems like a pretty consistent  result and there's an interesting point  I put this on Twitter and a number of  folks um you know replied and someone  sent me this paper which is pretty  interesting and it mentions recency bias  is one possible reason so the most  informative tokens for predicting the  next token uh you know are are are  present close to or recent to kind of  where you're doing your generation and  so there's a bias to attend to recent  tokens which is obviously not great for  the retrieval problem as we saw here so  again the results show us that um  reasoning is a bit harder than retrieval  more needles is more difficult and  needles towards the start of your  context are harder to retrieve than  towards the end those are three main  observations from this and it maybe  indeed due to this recency bias so  overall what this kind of tells you is  be wary of just context stuffing in  large long context  there are no retrieval  guarantees and also there's some recent  results that came out actually just  today suggesting that single needle may  be misleadingly easy um you know there's  no reasoning it's retrieving a single  needle um and also these guys I'm I  showed this tweet here show that um the  in a lot of these needle and Haack  challenges including mine the facts that  we look for are very different than um  the background kind of Hy stack of Paul  Graham essays and so that may be kind of  an interesting artifact they note that  indeed if the needle is more subtle  retrievals is worse so I think basically  when you see these really strong  performing needle and hyack analyses put  up by model providers you should be  skeptical um you shouldn't necessarily  assume that you're going to get high  quality retrieval from these long  contact LMS uh for numerous reasons you  need to think about retrieval of  multiple facts um you need to think  about reasoning on top of retrieval you  need need to think about the subtlety of  the retrieval relative to the background  context because for many of these needle  and the Haack challenges it's a single  needle no reasoning and the needle  itself is very different from the  background so anyway those may all make  the challenge a bit easier than a real  world scenario of fact retrieval so I  just want to like kind of lay out that  those cautionary notes but you know I  think it is fair to say this will  certainly get better and I think it's  also fair to say that rag will change  and this is just like a nearly not a  great joke but Frank zap a musician made  the point Jazz isn't dead it just smells  funny you know I think same for rag rag  is not dead but it will change I think  that's like kind of the key Point here  um so just as a followup on that rag  today's focus on precise retrieval of  relevant doc chunks so it's very focused  on typically taking documents chunking  them in some particular way often using  very OS syncratic chunking methods  things like chunk size are kind of  picked almost arbitrarily embeding them  storing them in an index taking a  question embedding it doing K&N uh  similarity search to retrieve relevant  chunks you're often setting a k  parameter which is the number of chunks  you retrieve you often will do some kind  of filtering or Pro processing on the  retrieve chunks and then ground your  answer in those retrieved chunks so it's  very focused on precise retrieval of  just the right chunks now in a world  where you have very long context models  I think there's a fair question to ask  is is this really kind of the most most  reasonable approach so kind of on the  left here you can kind of see this  notion closer to today of I need the  exact relevant chunk you can risk over  engineering you can have you know higher  complexity sensitivity to these odd  parameters like chunk size k um and you  can indeed suffer lower recall because  you're really only picking very precise  chunks you're beholden to very  particular embedding models so you know  I think going forward as long context  models get better and better there are  definitely question you should certainly  question the current kind of very  precise chunking rag Paradigm but on the  flip side I think just throwing all your  docs into context probably will also not  be the preferred approach you'll suffer  higher latency higher token usage I  should note that today 100,000 token GPD  4 is like $1 per generation I spent a  lot of money on Lang Chain's account uh  on that multile analysis I don't want to  tell Harrison how much I spent uh so  it's it's you know it's not good right  um You Can't audit retrieve  um and security and and authentication  are issues if for example you need  different users different different  access to certain kind of retriev  documents or chunks in the Contex  stuffing case you you kind of can't  manage security as easily so there's  probably some predo optimal regime kind  of here in the middle and um you know I  I put this out on Twitter I think  there's some reasonable points raised I  think you know this inclusion at the  document level is probably pretty sane  documents are self-contained chunks of  context um so you know what about  document Centric rag so no chunking uh  but just like operate on the context of  full documents so you know if you think  forward to the rag Paradigm that's  document Centric you still have the  problem of taking an input question  routing it to the right document um this  doesn't change so I think a lot of  methods that we think about for kind of  query analysis um taking an input  question rewriting it in a certain way  to optimize retrieval things like  routing taking a question routing to the  right database be it a relational  database graph database Vector store um  and quer construction methods so for  example text to SQL text to Cipher for  graphs um or text to even like metadata  filters for for Vector stores those are  all still relevant in the world that you  have long Contex llms um you're probably  not going to dump your entire SQL DB and  feed that to the llm you're still going  to have SQL queries you're still going  to have graph queries um you may be more  permissive with what you extract but it  still is very reasonable to store the  majority of your structured data in  these in these forms likewise with  unstructured data like documents like we  said before it still probably makes  sense to ENC to you know store documents  independently but just simply aim to  retrieve full documents rather than  worrying about these idiosyncratic  parameters like like chunk size um and  along those lines there's a lot of  methods out there we've we've done a few  of these that are kind of well optimized  for document retrieval so one I want a  flag is what we call multi repesent  presentation indexing and there's  actually a really nice paper on this  called dense X retriever or proposition  indexing but the main point is simply  this would you do is you take your OD  document you produce a representation  like a summary of that document you  index that summary right and then um at  retrieval time you ask your question you  embed your question and you simply use a  highle summary to just retrieve the  right document you pass the full  document to the LM for a kind of final  generation so it's kind of a trick where  you don't have to worry about embedding  full documents in this particular case  you can use kind of very nice  descriptive summarization prompts to  build descriptive summaries and the  problem you're solving here is just get  me the right document it's an easier  problem than get me the right chunk so  this is kind of a nice approach it  there's also different variants of it  which I share below one is called parent  document retriever where you could use  in principle if you wanted smaller  chunks but then just return full  documents but anyway the point is  preserving full documents for Generation  but using representations like summaries  or chunks for retrieval so that's kind  of like approach one that I think is  really interesting approach two is this  idea of raptor is a cool paper came out  of Stamper somewhat recently and this  solves the problem of what if for  certain questions I need to integrate  information across many documents so  what this approach does is it takes  documents and it it embeds them and  clusters them and then it summarizes  each cluster um and it does this  recursively in up with only one very  high level summary for the entire Corpus  of documents and what they do is they  take this kind of this abstraction  hierarchy so to speak of different  document summarizations and they just  index all of it and they use this in  retrieval and so basically if you have a  question that draws an information  across numerous documents you probably  have a summary present and and indexed  that kind of has that answer captured so  it's a nice trick to consolidate  information across documents um they  they paper actually reports you know  these documents in their case or the  leavs are actually document chunks or  slices but I actually showed I have a  video on it and a notebook that this  works across full documents as well um  and this and I segue into to do this you  do need to think about long context  embedding models because you're  embedding full documents and that's a  really interesting thing to track um the  you know hazy research uh put out a  really nice um uh blog post on this  using uh what the Monch mixer so it's  kind of a new architecture that tends to  longer context they have a 32,000 token  embedding model that's pres that's  available on together AI absolutely  worth experimenting with I think this is  really interesting Trend so long long  Contex and beddings kind of play really  well with this kind of idea you take  full documents embed them using for  example long Contex embedding models and  you can kind of build these document  summarization trees um really  effectively so I think this another nice  trick for working with full documents in  the long context kind of llm regime um  one other thing I'll note I think  there's also going to Mo be move away  from kind of single shot rag well  today's rag we typically you know we  chunk documents uh uh embed them store  them in an index you know do retrieval  and then do generation but there's no  reason why you shouldn't kind of do  reasoning on top of the generation or  reasoning on top of the retrieval and  feedback if there are errors so there's  a really nice paper called selfrag um  that kind of reports this we implemented  this using Lang graph works really well  and the simp the idea is simply to you  know grade the relevance of your  documents relative to your question  first if they're not relevant you  rewrite the question you can do you can  do many things in this case we do  question rewriting and try again um we  also grade for hallucinations we grade  for answer relevance but anyway it kind  of moves rag from like a single shot  Paradigm to a kind of a cyclic flow uh  in which you actually do various  gradings Downstream and this is all  relev in the long context llm regime as  well in fact you know it you you  absolutely should take advantage of of  for example increasingly fast and  Performing LMS to do this grading um  Frameworks like langra allow you to  build these kind of these flows which  build which allows you to kind of have a  more performant uh kind of kind of  self-reflective rag pipeline now I did  get a lot of questions about latency  here and I completely agree there's a  trade-off between kind of performance  accuracy and latency that's present here  I think the real answer is you can opt  to use very fast uh for example models  like grock where seeing um you know gp35  turbos very fast these are fairly easy  grading challenges so you can use very  very fast LMS to do the grading and for  example um you you can also restrict  this to only do one turn of of kind of  cyclic iteration so you can kind of  restrict the latency in that way as well  so anyway I think it's a really cool  approach still relevant in the world as  we move towards longer context so it's  kind of like building reasoning on top  of rag um in the uh generation and  retrieval stages and a related point one  of the challenges with rag is that your  index for example you you may have a  question that is that asks something  that's outside the scope of your index  and this is kind of always a problem so  a really cool paper called c c rag or  corrective rag came out you know a  couple months ago that basically does  grading just like we talked about before  and then if the documents are not  relevant you kick off and do a web  search and basically return the search  results to the LM for final generation  so it's a nice fallback in cases where  um your you the questions out of the  domain of your retriever so you know  again nice trick overlaying reasoning on  top of rag I think this trend you know  continues um because you know it it just  it makes rag systems you know more  performant uh and less brittle to  questions that are out of domain so you  know you know that's another kind of  nice idea this particular approach also  we showed works really well with with uh  with open source models so I ran this  with mraw 7B it can run locally on my  laptop using a llama so again really  nice approach I encourage you to look  into this um and this is all kind of  independent of the llm kind of context  length these are reasoning you can add  on top of the retrieval stage that that  can kind of improve overall performance  and so the overall picture kind of looks  like this where you know I think that  the the the the problem of routing your  question to the right database Andor to  the right document kind of remains in  place query analysis is still quite  relevant routing is still relevant query  construction is still relevant um in the  long Contex regime I think there is less  of an emphasis on document chunking  working with full documents is probably  kind of more parto optimal so to speak  um there's some some clever tricks for  IND indexing of documents like the  multi-representation indexing we talked  about the hierarchical indexing using  Raptor that we talked about as well are  two interesting ideas for document  Centric indexing um and then kind of  reasoning in generation post retrieval  on retrieval itself tog grade on the  generations themselves checking for  hallucinations those are all kind of  interesting and relevant parts of a rag  system that I think we'll probably will  see more and more of as we move more  away from like a more naive prompt  response Paradigm more to like a flow  Paradigm we're seeing that actually  already in codenation it's probably  going to carry over to rag as well where  we kind of build rag systems that have  kind of a cyclic flow to them operate on  documents use longc Comics llms um and  still use kind of routing and query  analysis so reasoning pre- retrieval  reasoning post- retrieval so anyway that  was kind of my talk um and yeah feel  free to leave any comments on the video  and I'll try to answer any questions but  um yeah that's that's probably about it  thank you\", metadata={'source': 'sVcwVQRHIc8', 'title': 'Learn RAG From Scratch – Python AI Tutorial from a LangChain Engineer',

augmented generation which is one of the  most popular kind of ideas and  in llms  today so really the motivation for this  is that most of the world's data is  private um whereas llms are trained on

consolidation across kind broad swast of  a document so across like many documents  or many chunks within a document and you  can call those like higher level  questions and so there's kind of this
